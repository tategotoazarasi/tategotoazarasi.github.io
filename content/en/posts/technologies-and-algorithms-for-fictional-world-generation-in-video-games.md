## Introduction

Procedural world generation is the process of algorithmically creating expansive fictional worlds – including geography,
climate, and ecosystems – without manual design. This technology underpins games like **Minecraft** and **Dwarf Fortress
**, enabling infinite or vast maps with unique terrain and history each playthrough . For example, *Dwarf Fortress*
simulates entire histories and ecologies on a pseudo-randomly generated world, producing rich lore (ancient heroes,
wars, monsters) tied to the geography . The appeal of procedural generation is twofold: **content variety** (players
continually discover new landscapes) and **development efficiency** (worlds are stored as a random seed rather than
hand-crafted, saving memory and authoring effort ).

However, generating a believable world involves more than random noise. Real planets are shaped by complex geophysical
processes: continental drift, mountain uplift, erosion by water and wind, climate patterns, and biome evolution. Purely
random terrain often lacks coherent structure – for instance, real mountain ranges align along tectonic plate
boundaries, not arbitrarily . Thus, modern procedural world generators combine noise functions with simulated physics to
produce plausible worlds. In this thesis, we survey the key techniques for fictional world generation, including **map
geometry (flat vs. spherical worlds)**, **landmass formation (noise-based and plate tectonic methods)**, **terrain
refinement (erosion, rivers)**, **climate and biome simulation**, **map data structures (grid tiles, graphs, sphere
partitions)**, and **region partitioning by natural boundaries**. We review both academic research and industry
implementations (e.g. *WorldEngine*, *Mapgen4*, *Tectonics.js*, *ExoPlaSim*, *PyTectonics*), highlighting
state-of-the-art methods. Code examples in C++ are provided to illustrate core algorithms, and mathematical models are
included for rigor. We conclude with proposals for next-generation world generation systems and an outline of a unified
implementation framework.

## Procedural Map Geometry: Flat vs. Spherical Worlds

**Flat maps** (planar worlds) have been common in games due to simplicity – the world is a 2D plane, potentially
infinite or bounded by edges. Infinite 2D maps (as in *Minecraft*) can be generated chunk by chunk, often using periodic
noise so that terrain extends
seamlessly ([3DWorld: Domain Warping Noise](http://3dworldgen.blogspot.com/2017/05/domain-warping-noise.html#:~:text=Keep
in mind that 3DWorld,I'm currently trying to improve)). Flat worlds suit many fantasy settings but impose unrealistic
edges or repetition if made finite. Some generators wrap the edges to eliminate borders, effectively mapping a plane to
a torus (e.g. repeating East-West and North-South). Wrapping avoids edges but is still topologically different from a
sphere (a torus has two independent wrap directions) .

**Spherical worlds** (planetary maps) offer a more Earth-like experience, especially for strategy and simulation games.
Generating a spherical world raises unique challenges: how to represent the surface without distortion or singularities.
A straightforward approach is an equirectangular projection (latitude-longitude grid), but this stretches areas near the
poles and creates singular points at the poles themselves. Alternatives include subdividing Platonic solids or using
geodesic grids:

- An **icosahedral geodesic grid** projects the sphere onto an icosahedron, then subdivides it. This yields mostly
  hexagonal cells with 12 pentagons (like a soccer ball). Such **hexagon-pentagon tilings** provide fairly uniform cell
  sizes and are used in some climate models and planetary generators . The drawback is more complex data structures to
  handle the 12 pentagons and neighbor relationships.
- A **cube map** projects the globe onto six faces of a cube, each of which can be treated as a square grid. This avoids
  extreme distortion and singularities (each cube face is a self-contained grid), but at the cost of discontinuities at
  the cube edges.
- **Fibonacci lattices** or other spiral point distributions can place points quasi-uniformly on a sphere for mesh-based
  representations . For example, Amit Patel’s approach to sphere mapping uses a set of points evenly distributed on the
  sphere (via recursive subdivision or energy minimization), then jittered slightly to avoid a too-regular look . A
  Delaunay triangulation of these points yields a spherical mesh (geodesic triangulation) suitable for applying noise
  and simulation.

**Hexagonal vs. square tiles:** When using a 2D grid representation for maps (whether flat or on each face of a cube
map), designers must choose tile shapes. Square grids are simplest and align with image pixels, but **hexagonal grids**
are often favored for strategy worlds because of their symmetry – each hexagon has six equal neighbors, which better
approximates continuous directions than the 4 or 8 neighbors in a square grid. Movement costs and distances are uniform
in a hex grid, whereas a square grid needs special handling for diagonals. Hex grids also allow natural-looking
continental shapes and axial mountain ranges due to their connectivity. Many games (e.g. *Civilization V*) switched from
square to hex tiles to eliminate directional bias and offer a more organic layout. Implementation of hex grids requires
axial or cube coordinates and careful wraparound logic for spherical maps , but robust algorithms exist in literature
and developer guides (e.g., Red Blob Games’ axial coordinate system for hex maps ).

**Irregular, graph-based meshes:** Another approach is to use irregular polygons (e.g. Voronoi cells) instead of uniform
tiles. This can create more natural coastlines and region shapes. Patel’s *Polygon Map Generation* technique is a
seminal example: it generates points on a plane or sphere, computes a Voronoi diagram, and uses those irregular polygons
as “tiles” for the map . This method gives a graph of adjacencies more akin to real geography (where political or biome
boundaries are irregular). **Voronoi regions** can represent drainage basins or tectonic plates nicely, and the graph
structure enables interesting simulations (rivers flowing along edges, etc.). Patel found Voronoi “provided a good
skeleton” for placing rivers and terrain features in his maps . The downside is higher computational cost for the
geometry and more complex algorithms for spatial queries. Nonetheless, irregular meshes have been used successfully in
projects like *Mapgen4* and *Tectonics.js*, as well as academic planetary models .

In summary, map geometry choices influence all downstream generation steps. A **spherical Voronoi mesh** is arguably the
most powerful (minimal distortion, irregular realism), but many implementations opt for simpler planar grids or wrapped
tiles for performance and ease. Modern solutions exist to **partition spheres** with near-uniform cells and handle
neighbor relationships, enabling truly planet-sized worlds in games and simulations.

## Landmass Generation: Continents and Oceans

At the highest level, a world generator must decide how to distribute **land vs. sea**. Realistically, water covers most
of Earth (~71%), and land forms one or several large continents with numerous islands. Two major paradigms exist for
generating landmass layouts: **noise-based heightmaps** and **tectonic simulation**.

### Fractal Noise Heightmaps

**Noise functions** are a foundation of procedural terrain. Classic methods treat the world as a heightfield (a
function $H(x,y)$ giving elevation) and use fractal noise to populate it. **Value noise** is the simplest: a grid of
random values is interpolated to produce a continuous field. **Gradient noise**, notably **Perlin Noise** (Ken Perlin,
1985), improved this by assigning random gradient vectors to lattice points and interpolating smoothly . The result is a
smoother, more natural-looking variation than value noise. Perlin noise (and its later variant **Simplex noise**, 2001)
yield pseudo-random hills and valleys that are statistically homogeneous – good for generating “somewhere” terrain, but
lacking structure like long mountain chains or plateaus.

To create large features, noise is often combined in octaves to form **fractal Brownian motion (fBm)**: summing multiple
noise layers at different frequencies. Low-frequency noise gives broad continents; high-frequency noise adds fine
detail. By adjusting amplitude and frequency per octave (e.g. halving amplitude each time for a $1/f$ spectrum), one
gets natural roughness. The C++ code below demonstrates generating a heightmap using layered noise:

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <cmath>
#include <random>

// Placeholder noise function: returns noise value in [-1,1] for coordinates (x,y).
double noise2D(double x, double y);

// Generate fractal noise (fBm) by summing octaves of noise
double octaveNoise(double x, double y, int octaves, double persistence = 0.5) {
    double value = 0.0;
    double amplitude = 1.0;
    double frequency = 1.0;
    for(int i = 0; i < octaves; ++i) {
        value += amplitude * noise2D(x * frequency, y * frequency);
        amplitude *= persistence;
        frequency *= 2.0;
    }
    return value;
}

int main() {
    const int width = 1024, height = 1024;
    std::vector<std::vector<double>> heightmap(height, std::vector<double>(width));
    // (Initialize noise permutation or gradient tables here...)
    for(int y = 0; y < height; ++y) {
        for(int x = 0; x < width; ++x) {
            // Normalize coordinates to [0,1] range for tiling
            double nx = double(x) / width;
            double ny = double(y) / height;
            // 5-octave fractal noise elevation
            double elevation = octaveNoise(nx, ny, 5);
            heightmap[y][x] = elevation;
        }
    }
    // ... (Use heightmap: e.g., define sea level, etc.)
}
```

This approach quickly generates an **elevation map**. By choosing a sea-level threshold (e.g., the 30th percentile of
height values to make ~70% ocean  ), we can classify ocean vs. land and reveal continents. **Simplex noise** in
particular is popular for world generation because it avoids directional artifacts and operates well in 3D (for spheres
or volumetric worlds) . However, as noted, pure noise has no knowledge of geology – terrain features appear random. A
simplex noise elevation map “is not realistic” by itself, lacking the linear structure of real ranges .

**Domain-warping noise** is a technique to inject more complexity into noise-based terrain. The idea (coined by Steven
Worley and popularized by Inigo Quílez) is to distort the coordinate space of one noise function by another. For
example, given two noise fields $f$ and $g$, one can compute height $= f(x + \alpha,g(x,y),; y + \alpha,g(x,y))$. This *
*warps** the terrain, creating twisting ridges and valleys beyond what basic noise produces. Domain warping can yield
terrain that superficially resembles the result of erosion – with **river-like valleys and steep ridges** appearing from
the warped
patterns ([3DWorld: Domain Warping Noise](http://3dworldgen.blogspot.com/2017/05/domain-warping-noise.html#:~:text=Domain
warping adds a swirly,map view screenshot from
3DWorld)) ([3DWorld: Domain Warping Noise](http://3dworldgen.blogspot.com/2017/05/domain-warping-noise.html#:~:text=The
features in this scene,rather than being single triangles)). In one experiment, warping simplex noise produced features
“similar to eroded terrain with river valleys,” compared against satellite imagery of real
mountains ([3DWorld: Domain Warping Noise](http://3dworldgen.blogspot.com/2017/05/domain-warping-noise.html#:~:text=The
features in this scene,rather than being single triangles)). Domain warping is computationally cheap (just additional
noise lookups) and can be layered fractally as well. It does not truly simulate physics, but it adds visual realism to
fractal maps, often fooling the eye with features that look “carved.”

**Continent shapes** with noise: Basic fBm tends to produce scattered islands if thresholds are naively applied, or
unstructured blobs. Creators often apply ad-hoc shaping to get a few large continents. For instance, one can use a
large-scale low-frequency noise to define one big landmass versus ocean, or multiply the heightmap by a gradient that
lowers terrain near map edges (to create an ocean boundary). *WorldEngine* uses a clever trick: after initial noise,
they “translate the map to place the lowest elevation at the borders and the highest at the center,” then flood from the
edges to set sea level . This ensures a single connected continent in the center of the map with ocean around it,
mimicking a Pangea-like supercontinent on an ocean planet. Another technique is generating a few large elliptical masks
or using Voronoi cells to prescribe continent regions, then filling each with fractal detail. The **diamond-square
algorithm** (midpoint displacement) is another classic fractal method to create continent shapes, though it is less
flexible than noise and has a more grid-aligned output () ().

In summary, fractal noise provides the **base texture** of terrain – mountains, hills, plains – and is almost always
used at least to add fine detail . But without additional processing, noise alone lacks realism: real continents have *
*structured asymmetry** (long coasts, clustered mountains). This motivates the next approach: simulating the processes
that form continents.

### Plate Tectonics Simulation

Real continents arise from the movement of tectonic plates floating on a magma mantle. Simulating plate tectonics can
generate more plausible large-scale features: continental shapes, aligned mountain ranges, island arcs, and ocean
trenches. **Physically-based terrain generation via plate tectonics** was explored by early researchers like**†L43-L49】,
and has become feasible in modern hobby projects (e.g. *PyTectonics*, *Tectonics.js*) and
research ([[PDF\] Procedural Tectonic Planets | Semantic Scholar](https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/754067bc34d61506f06eff96ed673d87c3c93c2e#:~:text=Procedural
Tectonic Planets · Y,Geology%2C Computer Science%2C Physics)).

A simplified tectonic algorithm often works on a heightfield or planar mesh:

1. **Initialize plates**: Segment the world into a few (e.g. 6–20) rigid plates, each with an initial random velocity
   vector (). Plates can be represented as contiguous regions of the height grid or mesh. One method is to pick random
   “seeds” and flood-fill to partition the map into plates.
2. **Move plates**: For a time step, displace each plate according to its velocity (direction and speed). On a sphere,
   plates move along great circles.
3. **Detect collisions**: Determine where plates overlap or diverge after movement. At **convergent boundaries** (
   collision zones), simulate uplift; at **divergent boundaries** (separating plates), create rifts or new crust.
4. **Modify terrain**: Raise terrain in collision zones (mountain building), lower it or create valleys/trenches where
   plates separate or one subducts under another.
5. **Iterate**: Update plate assignments if necessary (plates can reform after significant movement) and repeat for many
   iterations (simulating millions of years).

A classic implementation of this was described by Viitanen (2012) and others. One approach describes dividing an initial
fractal terrain into ~10 plates, each with random drift; overlapping regions are uplifted by adding their heights
together, simulating mountain formation () (). After collision, a simple erosion/smoothing is applied and the process
repeats with newly segmented plates (). This iterative plate simulation can produce realistic continental layouts: *
*mountain ranges of varying size and shape emerge between colliding plates**, coastal ranges form from subduction, and
divergent plate boundaries in oceans create island chains that can merge into larger landmasses () (). Essentially, it
generates the kind of structured terrain features noise lacks: *“All of these are features that conventional fractal
terrains are missing.”* ()

A more physically faithful approach is used by *Tectonics.js*, a 3D plate simulation in the browser. It treats the
sphere as a discretized shell (tens of thousands of cells) and actually tracks crust density and age . In Tectonics.js,
oceanic crust cools and densifies with age; when it gets too dense, it subducts beneath lighter crust (often
continental) . The model computes **velocity fields** drawing plates toward subduction zones (using vector calculus on
the spherical grid) . Similar velocity vectors are clustered to identify distinct plates dynamically . As plates move,
overlapping crust at convergent boundaries is deleted (simulating one plate diving under another) , and gaps at
divergent boundaries are filled with new crust (mid-ocean ridges) . This results in continuously evolving plates that
naturally form features: long mountain ranges at collisions, arc-shaped island chains at certain convergences, and
realistic ocean basin spreading . The simulation is computationally heavy – *“instantaneous generation is out of the
question”* – but can run in minutes in a browser for a planet a few thousand cells across . The benefit is geological
consistency: every mountain or trench has a “why” behind it, which aids worldbuilding narrative or further simulation (
like placing volcanoes on subduction zones). Users of Tectonics.js have noted the increased realism: *“Not only is the
physical world generation impressive, the generated history… opens up story opportunities”* .

One outcome of tectonic methods is that **land/ocean distribution** is an emergent result rather than pre-set. For
example, *WorldEngine* starts with a simplex noise heightmap then explicitly **simulates plate movements, collisions,
and mountain uplift**  . This produces a more realistic general appearance of continents . The WorldEngine developers
noted that using plate simulation “puts [it] ahead of… competitors” in terms of realism . The downside, as Viitanen
concluded, is that pure plate simulation can lack small-scale detail – raw plate output gives broad strokes (large flat
ocean floors, smooth mountain chains) but can appear “bland” or empty in between () (). Viitanen’s implementation had
flat ocean floors and lacked features like **hotspots** (volcanic island chains not at plate boundaries) and *
*continental shelves** (). To address this, most systems hybridize noise and simulation: e.g. start with a noise-based
terrain to ensure fine variation, then overlay tectonic deformations, then maybe add noise back on top for roughness .
WorldEngine indeed does this: *“We start by using noise to generate the initial height map… Then we run the plate
simulation… To the final results we add more noise.”* . This combination yields realistic structure with natural
variation.

In practice, tectonic simulation need not be fully physically accurate – even a heuristic plate model can greatly
improve plausibility. A forum algorithm by user *Impaler[WrG]* (2005) segmented a heightmap into plates, shifted them,
uplifted overlaps, and re-smoothed, iteratively, producing convincing worlds with minimal computation () (). The key is
capturing essential effects: long mountain ranges along plate junctions, continent-sized crustal blocks, and ocean
basins. Simulated worlds inherently contain a **history**: one can trace that a mountain range was formed by X colliding
with Y, etc. As one developer put it, fractal maps have *“no history – an author would have to tack on explanations
after the fact”*, whereas a tectonic world lets you “look at a landscape and say why or how it formed” . This makes
tectonic-based worlds attractive for story-driven games and detailed simulations.

Finally, after tectonic processes shape the primary landmass configuration, additional steps often set sea level (
flooding low areas to create realistic coastlines)  and perform some terrain smoothing or basic erosion. The output at
this stage is a heightmap with plausible continents, mountains, and ocean floors, ready to be further refined by erosion
and river carving algorithms.

## Terrain Detailing: Erosion and River Simulation

Even after applying fractal noise and tectonic uplift, terrain can look “computer-generated” if it lacks the imprint of
erosion. In nature, **erosion by water, wind, and gravity** is the dominant force shaping landforms once they exist.
Erosion creates drainage networks (valleys, rivers, deltas), smooths sharp peaks into rolling hills, and deposits
sediments in floodplains and coasts. Therefore, simulating erosion is critical for realism – *“If you do not simulate
erosion you will never obtain realistic maps.”* .

### Hydraulic Erosion (Water)

**Hydraulic erosion** refers to erosion caused by water flow. This includes rain impact, rivers cutting channels, and
soil carried to oceans. It’s the most significant erosion type for large-scale terrain . Algorithms to simulate it come
in two flavors :

- **Eulerian (grid-based)**: Represent water as a fluid on the terrain grid. Each cell has a water height or volume;
  water flows to neighbors according to pressure gradients, carrying sediment. Models like these iterate fluid dynamics
  equations (often simplified shallow-water equations) and sediment transport equations over the grid . They can capture
  broad sheet erosion and deposition but can be complex and heavy to compute.
- **Lagrangian (particle-based)**: Represent water as particles or droplets that move across the terrain. Each raindrop
  lands and flows downhill, picking up sediment and depositing it as it slows . This is easier to implement and very
  popular in game algorithms (sometimes called the “rain droplet model”). It simulates individual small streams carving
  out paths.

A simple particle-based hydraulic erosion algorithm might work like this  :

1. **Rain:** Spawn a water particle (raindrop) at a random location on the heightmap. Give it an initial tiny volume of
   water.
2. **Flow:** While the droplet has water and hasn’t left the map:
    - Compute the surface **gradient** at the droplet’s current position from the heightmap (partial derivatives or
      neighboring heights).
    - Move the droplet a small step in the steepest downhill direction (its velocity increases downhill). Optionally
      keep track of velocity as a vector, which increases on downslope and decreases on upslope .
    - **Erode or deposit:** If the droplet is moving fast on a steep slope, it can carry more sediment (higher
      capacity). Compute the difference between the droplet’s current sediment load and its capacity (a function of
      water volume, velocity, slope)  . If carrying less than capacity, erode soil from the ground and add it to
      sediment; if carrying too much (capacity exceeded, usually when it slows on flat ground) deposit some sediment
      back to the terrain . This can be modeled
      as: $\text{capacity} = k \cdot |v| \cdot (h_\text{uphill} - h_\text{downhill})$ (water can carry more sediment
      with higher velocity $|v|$ and steep drop $h$) . Then:
        - $\text{erosion} = E \cdot (\text{capacity} - \text{sediment})$ (if capacity > current sediment) ,
        - $\text{deposit} = D \cdot (\text{sediment} - \text{capacity})$ (if sediment > capacity) , and update terrain
          height and droplet sediment accordingly.
    - Continue to next step from the new position.
3. **Evaporation:** Gradually evaporate some of the droplet’s water each step. If it runs out of water or slows to a
   stop in a pit, end the simulation for that droplet.

By repeating thousands of droplets, the heightmap is incrementally eroded. Channels form where many droplets traveled,
and sediment accumulates in low areas. Below is a C++ pseudo-code snippet illustrating one droplet simulation loop:

```cpp
struct Droplet { 
    double x, y;
    double vx, vy;
    double water;
    double sediment;
};

void simulateDroplet(Droplet& d, HeightMap& H) {
    for(int step = 0; step < maxSteps; ++step) {
        // Calculate height and gradient at droplet's position
        int cx = (int)floor(d.x), cy = (int)floor(d.y);
        double h = H.getHeight(d.x, d.y);
        Vector2 grad = H.getGradient(d.x, d.y);  // downhill gradient
        // Update velocity (downhill accelerates, some friction)
        d.vx = d.vx * (1 - friction) - grad.x * timeStep;
        d.vy = d.vy * (1 - friction) - grad.y * timeStep;
        // Move droplet
        d.x += d.vx * timeStep;
        d.y += d.vy * timeStep;
        if(d.x < 0 || d.x >= H.width() || d.y < 0 || d.y >= H.height()) break;
        // Compute new height after movement
        double newH = H.getHeight(d.x, d.y);
        double deltaH = h - newH;
        // Compute sediment capacity (k * speed * slope)
        double speed = sqrt(d.vx*d.vx + d.vy*d.vy);
        double capacity = std::max(minCapacity, sedimentConstant * speed * deltaH);
        // Erosion or deposition
        if(d.sediment > capacity) {
            // deposit excess sediment
            double depositAmt = (d.sediment - capacity) * depositRate;
            H.addHeight(cx, cy, depositAmt);
            d.sediment -= depositAmt;
        } else {
            // erode soil
            double erosionAmt = std::min((capacity - d.sediment) * erosionRate, h);
            H.addHeight(cx, cy, -erosionAmt);
            d.sediment += erosionAmt;
        }
        // Evaporate some water
        d.water *= (1 - evaporationRate);
        if(d.water < minWater) break;
    }
}
```

This code assumes a `HeightMap` class with methods to get height and gradient, and it updates the height values in
place. In a full implementation, you would also track the droplet’s last position and deposit at the **previous** cell,
not the current one, to avoid creating artificial pits  (this detail is omitted above for clarity).

**Performance:** Droplet-based erosion can be slow if millions of particles are needed. There are optimizations and even
GPU implementations (e.g. Mei et al. 2007’s “Fast Hydraulic Erosion Simulation on GPU” achieves interactive rates ).
Another optimization is to simulate **streams** rather than individual raindrops: for example, use a flow accumulation
model where each cell receives water from rainfall and upslope neighbors, then routes it downhill (like the Hydrology
models used in GIS). This can compute river networks more directly and is closer to a grid-based approach.

### Thermal Erosion (Weathering)

**Thermal erosion** (or weathering) simulates material collapsing due to gravity when slopes are too steep. It does not
involve water; instead, it’s like sand or rock dislodging from a cliff and accumulating at the base, a process driven by
the material’s angle of repose. A simple thermal erosion algorithm iteratively does:

- For each cell, find neighbors that are lower.
- If the slope to a neighbor exceeds some threshold (critical slope angle), transfer some material from the higher cell
  to the lower cell . This gradually evens out extremely sharp features, creating talus slopes. It’s often applied after
  hydraulic erosion to smooth unrealistic overhangs or spikes. Musgrave et al. (1989) introduced an early thermal
  erosion algorithm in which each iteration moves a fraction of the height difference (above the threshold) from a cell
  to its lower
  neighbor ([[PDF\] Layered Data Representation for Visual Simulation of Terrain Erosion](https://www.cs.purdue.edu/cgvlab/www/resources/papers/Benes-2001-Layered_data_representation_for_visual_simulation_of_terrain_ero.pdf#:~:text=,This)).
  The result is a more natural distribution of slopes.

Thermal erosion is computationally simpler than hydraulic. It can be run even on large heightmaps quickly, making it a
common post-process in terrain tools. Many pipelines do: fractal noise → plate simulation → hydraulic erosion → thermal
erosion (to smooth out the final details).

### River Network and Watershed Modeling

While hydraulic erosion inherently produces river channels, some world generators explicitly model **river paths** to
ensure major rivers exist (for gameplay or realism) even if erosion simulation is limited. There are a few approaches:

- **Drainage basin analysis**: Compute flow directions for each cell (usually the steepest downslope neighbor). From
  this, calculate flow accumulation (how many cells drain through each cell). High accumulation paths can be designated
  as rivers. This method uses the heightmap directly and can identify long river courses from mountains to ocean. It
  pairs well with noise-based terrain – one can generate a basic heightmap and then algorithmically determine where
  rivers would flow.
- **River carving**: Starting from chosen source points (e.g. high rainfall areas or near mountain peaks), simulate a
  river “carving” downwards. A river follows the gradient; if it hits a flat area or local minima, it might meander or
  form a lake. As it flows, lower the terrain along its path to create a river valley, and perhaps widen it near the
  mouth. This can be done with an iterative approach or even using a low-res flow simulation. *Mapgen4* by Amit Patel
  allows the user to sketch rivers, and then it carves them by lowering terrain and adjusting water flow accordingly .
- **Tectonic + rainfall**: In simulation-heavy systems, the rivers naturally emerge from the rainfall and runoff
  modeling. *WorldEngine* for example, after computing precipitation, explicitly determines water flow and identifies
  river networks by tracing flow paths to the sea . It groups flow into streams and calculates water volume for each,
  then marks tiles with significant flow as rivers . This ensures that realistic drainage systems (with main rivers and
  tributaries) appear on the map.

Rivers should ideally obey certain constraints: they generally flow from high altitude to sea, they merge (tributaries)
but do not split often (except at deltas), and large rivers rarely run completely enclosed inland (endorheic basins are
rare). World generators incorporate such rules to avoid unnatural river placement. One common post-check is to ensure
rivers always decrease in elevation – any violation indicates a depression (which might become a lake if closed, or is
an error to fix).

Additionally, identifying **watersheds** (the catchment areas of each river) can be useful. Watersheds give natural
regions partitioned by ridges – these are often used as geographic boundaries (for countries or biomes). Some generators
partition the world by major watershed or mountain ranges to create provinces.

In summary, erosion and river simulation turn a tectonically formed, noise-detailed terrain into a final believable
landscape. These processes carve **valleys** and spread **sediment**, creating the fertile plains and river deltas that
pure heightmaps lack. A world without them appears static; a world with them appears *alive* and aged. Given performance
constraints, many systems implement a simplified erosion (e.g. a single pass of droplet erosion or even just
domain-warping noise to fake
it ([3DWorld: Domain Warping Noise](http://3dworldgen.blogspot.com/2017/05/domain-warping-noise.html#:~:text=Domain
warping adds a swirly,map view screenshot from 3DWorld))) to get similar visual impact. But for ultimate realism, as
noted in *WorldEngine*, dedicating effort to hydraulic erosion is essential .

## Climate and Weather Simulation

Once the terrain (land, mountains, water) is generated, the next step is often to simulate the planet’s **climate** –
distribution of temperature, precipitation, wind patterns – and its effects on the environment. Climate simulation can
be extremely complex (general circulation models solving fluid dynamics), but in fictional world generation simpler
approximations are used to produce plausible variation of biomes (deserts vs. forests, tropics vs. poles).

Key climate variables to model:

- **Temperature**: Primarily a function of latitude (sunlight angle) and altitude (lapse rate), and secondarily
  influenced by ocean vs. land (maritime climates) and atmospheric circulation.
- **Precipitation**: Influenced by global circulation (e.g. equatorial rain belt, mid-latitude westerlies), presence of
  mountains (rain shadow effect), and proximity to water bodies (moisture source).
- **Wind**: The prevailing wind direction in each latitude band (e.g. east-to-west trade winds in tropics, west-to-east
  westerlies in mid-latitudes) will carry moisture and determine where rain falls.

A common simplified model is:

- Start with a latitudinal temperature gradient: e.g. $T(\phi) = T_{equator} - \Delta T \cdot (\sin|\phi|)$ to reduce
  temperature from equator to poles. Adjust local temperature by elevation (e.g. -6.5°C per 1000m, the environmental
  lapse rate).
- Set prevailing wind directions for bands: e.g. trade winds toward the west in tropics, westerlies toward east in
  temperate zones, etc., possibly with seasonal reversal (monsoons) if seasons are modeled.
- Simulate **orographic precipitation**: As wind carrying moisture hits a mountain, it rises, cools, and drops rain on
  the windward side, leaving a dry **rain shadow** on the leeward side . This can be modeled by moving “air parcels” or
  simply scanning across the map in wind direction order, removing moisture when high terrain is encountered .
- Account for global rainfall patterns: e.g. a band of high rainfall near the equator (the Intertropical Convergence
  Zone) and dry zones at around 30° latitude (deserts), another wet band in mid-latitudes, etc. These can be
  approximated with sine waves or simple rules.
- Compute **precipitation** at each point given the above factors.

*Mapgen4* provides a didactic example of a simplified climate algorithm. It models a single wind direction at a time and
spreads moisture: *“Use wind in a straight line to spread moisture across the map”*, iterating region by region in
sorted order (by dot product with wind direction) . Moisture is added (evaporation) over ocean and removed when crossing
mountains . In pseudocode:

```
For each cell in order of wind direction:
    moisture[cell] += evaporation[cell]   // ocean adds moisture
    moisture[cell] = moisture[cell] * (1 - elevation[cell])   // mountains reduce moisture capacity
    rain[cell] = max(0, moisture[cell] - capacity_after_mountain)  // rain falls if air can't hold moisture
    pass remaining moisture to downwind neighbors
```

This captures the essential: more rain on windward mountain slopes, aridity in shadows . Wind direction can be rotated
or varied by latitude to simulate global patterns. Patel notes he later refined the wind model to turn uphill/downhill
and account for terrain steering winds for added realism .

Another element is **continentality**: Interiors of large continents have more extreme temperatures and often less
moisture (since air loses moisture by the time it penetrates far inland). Many generators incorporate a
distance-from-ocean factor in precipitation or humidity calculations.

For a more rigorous approach, one can integrate a lightweight actual climate model. **ExoPlaSim** is an example: a 3D
global climate model of intermediate complexity (based on the PlaSim climate simulator) that can be used to simulate
exoplanet climates . Given a world’s topography, ExoPlaSim will simulate atmospheric circulation, heat transport, and
precipitation over years of model time. This is beyond typical game needs, but it has been used in academia to explore
climate on fictional or altered Earths. Paradise et al. (2021) demonstrated ExoPlaSim handling different rotation rates
and star types for exoplanets . For a fictional world generator, running such a model might be overkill, but it could
provide high realism for projects aiming to emulate real Earth-like climate zones.

Most game-oriented generators opt for a simpler **parametric climate**: derive temperature and precipitation from
latitude, elevation, and some random or noise-based variability. For instance, *WorldEngine* computes temperature as a
function of latitude and height, and precipitation as a function of temperature plus some noise . Specifically,
WorldEngine’s approach:

- Latitude and altitude → temperature map.
- Temperature and some noise → precipitation map (with tweaks to ensure, e.g., poles have low precipitation as snow).
- Then identifies biomes from those (discussed next). They deliberately did *not* simulate seasonal changes, focusing on
  annual averages .

It’s important to incorporate the **rain-shadow effect** explicitly, as it’s a primary cause of deserts (e.g. leeward
side of big mountain ranges like the Himalayas or Rockies). Without it, biome distribution will feel off. Many systems,
even if not doing a full wind simulation, at least reduce precipitation for tiles behind tall mountains relative to a
moisture source.

In summary, climate modeling in world generation ranges from simple heuristic distribution to full simulation. A guiding
principle from WorldEngine’s developers: *“understand which elements are most relevant and represent them
approximately”* . That usually means capturing latitude bands, altitude effects, and orographic rain, which yield
plausible patterns: e.g. hot damp jungles, cold dry tundra, etc., in the right places.

## Biome and Ecology Generation

With temperature and precipitation (and perhaps soil fertility from erosion simulation), the next layer is **biomes**:
classification of regions like desert, grassland, forest, rainforest, tundra, etc. Biomes are the “face” of the world
that players see (vegetation, ground cover, animals) and are crucial for gameplay variety.

The simplest way to assign biomes is via thresholds on temperature and moisture. A classic is the **Whittaker biome
diagram**, which plots annual precipitation vs. average temperature and delineates regions (e.g. warm & wet → tropical
rainforest; warm & dry → desert; cool & wet → taiga, etc.). WorldEngine uses a more detailed scheme: the **Holdridge
life zones**, which consider not just temperature and rainfall but also an index for evapotranspiration . Holdridge’s
system divides climates into ~36 types. WorldEngine implemented around 40 biome types ranging from “subpolar dry tundra”
to “tropical rain forest” to “subtropical desert scrub”, covering a wide gamut . They chose Holdridge for its detail and
because it doesn’t require simulating seasonality (which Köppen classification would)  .

The algorithm for biomes typically:

- Take each cell’s (temperature, precipitation) values (possibly also latitude or elevation zone).
- Look up which biome category that falls into.
- Possibly adjust contiguous areas for consistency (you might not want a single tile of rainforest in the middle of a
  desert region due to noise fluctuations – some smoothing or majority filter can help).

Some generators introduce additional nuance, like soil moisture or drainage (a swamp might require high rainfall and
poor drainage, e.g. near a river mouth or in a basin). *WorldEngine*, for example, simulates water flow and
“irrigation” – essentially how rivers spread moisture in nearby areas – and it tracks soil **permeability**, which
affects whether an area becomes marshy . They use noise to vary these factors so biomes aren’t too uniform.

In an advanced simulation, you could also simulate **vegetation growth** or competition. Academic models might use
agents or cellular automata for vegetation spread given climate. However, most pipelines directly assign biome types
from climate because it’s efficient and the result is satisfactory.

An interesting output of biome generation is that it often feeds back into visual terrain generation (for rendering).
For instance, if you know an area is forest, you might want to scatter tree objects or texture it with dense foliage; if
it’s desert, use sand dunes, etc. Some world generators also simulate **ecosystems** (animal distribution, etc.), but
that’s usually beyond the scope of terrain generation itself and more into game content.

In summary, biome generation is the payoff for all the previous steps: from plate tectonics we got mountains, which gave
rain shadows in climate, which combined with temperature yield deserts behind those mountains, etc. The result is a
patchwork of climate zones that make sense: for example, a desert and a savanna at subtropical latitudes on west side of
a continent (as on Earth), or boreal forests to tundra as one goes north toward polar regions. The world now has not
just shape but **character** – regions players can recognize as distinct ecological zones, each with their own resources
and beauty.

## Map Data Structures and Representation

Under the hood, how is the world stored? This section examines the data structures for representing maps and how the
choices enable or constrain the above simulations.

**Regular grids (raster heightmaps)**: Many implementations use a 2D array of height values plus arrays for climate
variables. This raster approach makes neighborhood operations (erosion, blur, flow) straightforward, and memory access
is predictable. Square grids are common here, though as discussed hex grids can be mapped onto 2D arrays with axial
coordinates. Heightmaps excel for continuous terrain but are less ideal if you need discrete regions or graph
navigation (you’d derive graph structures on top of them for rivers or political borders). Also, distortion on a sphere
is an issue – one can either not wrap the map (having artificial edges) or use a cylindrical projection with increasing
distortion at high latitudes. Some systems keep multiple representations: e.g. a base equirectangular grid for climate
and height, and a separate structure for plate polygons or biome regions.

**Voronoi/Delaunay graph**: An alternative is to store the world as a graph of irregular polygons (Voronoi cells) as
mentioned earlier. Each cell can have properties (elevation, moisture, biome) . The Red Blob *Polygon Map* approach used
a graph where corners, edges, and centers all held certain attributes (enabling river routing along edges, etc.)  .
Graph representations make it easier to define relationships like “this river flows from cell A to cell B to cell C” as
a linked list of nodes, or “these cells form one plate”. They also allow variable resolution (you can have more cells in
areas that need detail, like along coastlines). However, performing physics simulations on an irregular mesh is more
complex than on a grid – e.g., solving fluid flow on a Voronoi mesh requires careful weighting by edge length.

**Spherical subdivisions**: To truly simulate a globe, some use geodesic grids or other discrete global grid systems (
DGGS). For example, one could subdivide an icosahedron a few levels to get on the order of 10,000 faces and use those
for climate and plate simulation (some research does exactly this ). There’s even an ISO standard for DGGS which defines
hierarchical cell structures on a sphere. The benefit is no singularities (poles) and equal area cells. Tectonics.js and
Procedural Planet models often use such methods, essentially treating the sphere as the simulation space natively .

**Tiles vs. continuous**: Traditional game maps are “tiled” (each cell is one terrain type). But some modern approaches
are **tile-less** in that they treat the world as continuous functions. For instance, terrain can be stored as a set of
mathematical functions or as a continuous mesh. *Infinite* procedural worlds like those in Minecraft are technically
tile-based (cubes), but at the surface one perceives a continuous landscape (blocks are small). A tile-less approach
might be used in simulation – e.g., use a continuous noise function to query elevation on the fly rather than storing a
huge array, which allows truly infinite detail. Games like *No Man’s Sky* use procedural formulas to generate terrain
locally as the player moves, rather than storing entire planets.

**Multi-layer data**: A generated world isn’t just a heightmap. It often includes layers such as plate boundaries, river
networks (could be vector paths or marked cells), soil moisture, temperature, biomes, etc. In WorldEngine, for each tile
they store a rich set of attributes: *“tectonic plate id, ocean/land, elevation, water bodies (river/lake), icecap
presence, humidity, precipitation, temperature, biome”* . All these layers together form the complete world model. This
data is often exported in formats like GIS rasters or images. WorldEngine, for example, can export heightmaps to
standard GIS formats via GDAL , and it can save the entire world in a structured format (like HDF5 or a protobuf) for
use in other programs . This separation of layers also aids visualization – for instance, one can render a precipitation
map or a temperature map independently , which is useful for debugging or game mechanics (showing a player a climate
overlay perhaps).

Ultimately, the choice of representation ties back to the **intended use** of the world. If you need fast lookup of
“what biome is here” or pathfinding, a grid or easily indexed structure is needed. If you want maximum realism and don’t
mind a heavier pre-computation, a spherical mesh with physically based simulation might be chosen. Modern computing
allows millions of grid cells or mesh nodes, so quite detailed worlds are possible (e.g., ~4096×2048 grids for
Earth-level detail). The generator must be designed to handle memory and computation efficiently for whatever structure
is used.

## Case Studies of World Generation Systems

To ground the above concepts, we examine a few notable world generation projects from academia and industry, analyzing
how they implement these techniques:

- **WorldEngine (2015)**: An open-source world generator that integrates multiple simulations . WorldEngine’s pipeline
  is:* noise → plate tectonics → flooding for sea → temperature → precipitation → erosion → rivers → biomes*. It uses
  simplex noise initially, then a plate simulation raising mountains , then picks sea level to get a target % land.
  Temperature is latitude- and elevation-based , precipitation is based on temperature plus noise . Hydraulic erosion is
  simulated by selecting random flow sources and tracing water downhill, removing terrain and depositing sediment ,
  resulting in refined river valleys. It computes river networks and water volume per river segment , and even tracks
  irrigation from rivers and soil humidity . Finally, icecaps are added based on temperature (freezing near poles and
  high altitudes) , and biomes are assigned using Holdridge life zones . *WorldEngine* demonstrates the benefit of
  combining techniques: the authors highlight that without plate tectonics, noise alone couldn’t make realistic
  large-scale structure , and without erosion, terrain would lack realistic river channels . By doing both, the
  generator produces worlds where one can see analogues of real Earth features (as shown by their comparison of
  generated mountains to the Andes and islands to a Japanese island chain) . WorldEngine outputs multiple map layers (
  height, precipitation, temperature, biome, etc.), and even has an “ancient map” style renderer for fun . It can export
  to standard formats like **TMX tile maps** for game integration . In summary, WorldEngine is a comprehensive case
  study of applying academic knowledge (plate tectonics, climate modeling, erosion algorithms) in a practical tool.
- **Mapgen4 (2018)**: A procedural fantasy map generator by Amit Patel (Red Blob Games). It is notable for being
  web-based and interactive – the user can paint mountains or oceans and the generator fills in the rest . Internally,
  Mapgen4 uses a Voronoi graph for the mesh. Its algorithms include: fast **multithreaded** calculation of elevation
  using distance fields (for efficient mountain shape blending) , simulation of **wind and rainfall** to determine
  moisture and rivers , and assignment of biomes accordingly . The user interaction aspect – painting a feature and
  regenerating – means the generation must be very fast. Patel achieved this with optimized data structures and
  parallelism . Mapgen4 also has unique touches like rendering the map in a stylized 3D-ish way with oblique projection
  to resemble hand-drawn fantasy maps . It shows that even on the web, one can implement many of the concepts: e.g., it
  models orographic rainfall (dry areas behind mountains if you paint a range) and dynamic rivers that respond to
  changes in the terrain instantly . While not documented in an academic paper, Mapgen4’s code and blog posts illustrate
  how to integrate climate and erosion heuristics in real time. It cites using a binary space partition for river
  routing and treating rivers as a tree data structure for efficient updates .
- **Tectonics.js / Platec / PyTectonics (2014–2018)**: These are a lineage of plate tectonic simulators by various
  developers (Carl Davidson’s *Tectonics.js* and earlier *pytectonics*, and *PlaTec* by others ). *Tectonics.js* we
  discussed: it emphasizes scientific plausibility and directly simulates plate physics on a sphere . Its outputs are
  heightmaps with very Earth-like continent configurations. However, as some users note, it’s harder to control exact
  outcomes (like number of continents or land fraction) with pure simulation . Tools like Platec (a simpler C++ library)
  implement 2D plate models that can be plugged into games for generating heightmaps with mountains at plate clashes.
  These tools often are used in conjunction: e.g. using Platec to get the base terrain, then running a separate erosion
  pass (Platec doesn’t do erosion itself). They have proven the viability of plate simulation even in
  performance-constrained environments. For instance, Platec can generate a 1024×1024 terrain with plate simulation in
  seconds, by simplifying the physics and using only 10–20 plates.
- **Procedural Tectonic Planets (2019)**: An academic project by Cortial *et
  al.* ([[PDF\] Procedural Tectonic Planets | Semantic Scholar](https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/754067bc34d61506f06eff96ed673d87c3c93c2e#:~:text=Procedural
  Tectonic Planets · Y,Geology%2C Computer Science%2C Physics)) that presented a method to interactively design planets
  using tectonic simulation. The user could sketch initial continental configurations, then the system uses procedural
  modeling to simulate tectonic drift and generate the final topography. The key contribution was allowing *authoring
  control* (addressing the unpredictability of pure simulation) while still leveraging the realism of tectonic
  processes. They used a multi-resolution approach: coarse plates for main structure, then higher-resolution noise for
  small details, plus a basic erosion simulation to sharpen the realism. Their results could produce Earth-sized planet
  maps (with continents, mountain ranges, island arcs) that a user directed. This represents the state-of-the-art in
  combining user input, simulation, and procedural detail for world generation .
- **ExoPlaSim (2021)**: While not a full terrain generator, ExoPlaSim is noteworthy as a climate system that can be
  *plugged into* fictional worlds. A workflow could be: generate a world’s terrain with any method, then feed it into
  ExoPlaSim to simulate climate and get temperature/precipitation maps, which then inform biomes. Paradise *et al.*
  demonstrated ExoPlaSim on various hypothetical worlds (tidally locked planets, high-obliquity worlds, etc.) . It
  provides a Python API to run simulations on desktop or clusters. In context of world generation, ExoPlaSim could be
  used for the most scientifically rigorous climate generation if needed (for example, in a hard sci-fi game or a
  scientific visualization of an imagined planet). It’s a reminder of how far one can go – up to full GCMs – although
  for most games, simpler models suffice.
- **Ranmantaru Worlds (Arcane Worlds, 2017)**: Indie developer Alexey Volynskov (Ranmantaru Games) shared his approach
  to procedural world generation tailored to gameplay needs. In Arcane Worlds (inspired by Magic Carpet), he **bases
  terrain generation around gameplay elements**: one can place required gameplay features (like an item or boss arena),
  and the system will build terrain around them
  logically ([Arcane Worlds 0.22](http://ranmantaru.com/blog/2014/07/28/arcane-worlds-0-22/#:~:text=I rewrote most of
  the,build the terrain around that)). This is a reverse approach to pure simulation – it ensures the world serves game
  design first, then fills in natural terrain second. He reported rewriting world generation in terms of modular
  elements that the algorithm integrates, achieving a hand-crafted feel with procedural
  techniques ([Arcane Worlds 0.22](http://ranmantaru.com/blog/2014/07/28/arcane-worlds-0-22/#:~:text=I rewrote most of
  the,build the terrain around that)). This case study highlights an important aspect: sometimes pure realism must be
  balanced against game design. A completely realistic world might be boring or unsuitable for the game’s needs (e.g. no
  flat area for a city, or too many impassable mountains). Arcane Worlds’ generator presumably uses noise and possibly
  cellular automata (given the voxel engine) but prioritizes controllability. It reminds us that “interesting” terrain
  in games is not always the same as “realistic” – procedural generation can be guided by artistic constraints.

Each of these case studies reinforces core concepts:

- **Hybrid methods** (noise + simulation + heuristics) yield the best results.
- **Data richness**: storing multiple layers (plates, rivers, etc.) enables more gameplay and narrative opportunities .
- **Performance vs. realism trade-offs**: e.g., Mapgen4 chooses simpler physics to allow interactive editing, whereas
  Tectonics.js goes heavy on physics at cost of speed, and Procedural Tectonic Planets tries to get both via user
  guidance.
- **Importance of erosion and climate**: All advanced generators include at least some erosion and climate modeling,
  underlining their necessity for believable worlds .
- **Community and reuse**: Many projects build on each other (Platec used in games, Patel’s algorithms inspiring
  others ). There’s a growing body of *knowledge and tools* to draw on, making this field accessible to even solo
  developers.

## Future Directions and Proposed Framework

Fictional world generation is approaching a point where **entire worlds can be generated with convincing detail**, but
there remain open challenges and opportunities for innovation. Based on our survey, several future directions and ideas
emerge:

- **Unified Pipeline with Modularity**: We propose an **implementation framework** that modularizes each aspect (plates,
  erosion, climate, biomes) with clear interfaces. For example, one could plug in different erosion modules (fast
  noise-based vs. slow simulation-based) depending on needs. The framework would pass the world data layer by layer:
  first a base elevation is created, then modified by plate module (if enabled), then erosion module, then climate
  module, etc. Each module would ideally annotate the map with its outputs (e.g., plate module outputs a plate-id map
  and stress map, erosion outputs a river network and new heightmap, climate outputs temperature & precipitation grids).
  Having a modular design allows developers or researchers to swap in more advanced algorithms as needed. For instance,
  one could test replacing a simple rainfall model with a call to ExoPlaSim within this pipeline for higher accuracy.
- **Improved Plate Models**: Future work could involve modeling plates at a finer granularity. Viitanen suggested moving
  from treating plates as rigid slabs to modeling them “point by point” – effectively a cellular automaton of plate
  dynamics (). With GPU computing, one could simulate hundreds of mini-plates interacting, which might produce more
  varied mountain shapes and even simulate phenomena like plate tearing and microplates. Additionally, integrating
  volcanism (hotspot island chains like Hawaii) and isostasy (vertical rebounding of crust) would add touches of realism
  currently missing.
- **Coupling Erosion and Tectonics**: In reality, erosion feedback affects tectonics (wearing down mountains, depositing
  sediment that can weigh down crust). A next-gen simulation might loosely couple these: for instance, after generating
  mountains, estimate erosion over a few million years and slightly reduce mountain heights accordingly, or have erosion
  influence sedimentary rock formation which could then be uplifted. This could be complex, but even a simplified
  coupling would ensure mountains are not “too tall and jagged” given the time scale since their uplift.
- **Dynamic Climates and Seasons**: Most current generators produce a static climate (average annual values).
  Introducing seasonal variation and dynamic climate could open new storytelling possibilities (e.g., an ice age comes,
  or monsoon seasons). One idea is to simulate the planet’s orbit and axial tilt to compute insolation over the year,
  and then derive seasonal temperature swings. One could then classify not just biome but seasonal biome (e.g.,
  deciduous forest vs. evergreen depending on seasonality). This was deliberately avoided by WorldEngine for
  simplicity , but with increased computing power it could be feasible to incorporate a lightweight seasonal model.
- **Vegetation Succession and Fauna**: Pushing beyond biomes, a future generator might simulate the *ecological
  succession* in each biome – how forests regrow after fires, or how certain animal species migrate. While this enters
  the realm of content generation more than terrain, the terrain lays the groundwork for it. For instance, given a
  climate map, one could simulate forest coverage over centuries, including events like wildfires (perhaps randomly
  ignited). Similarly, distribution of fantasy creatures or civilizations could be simulated based on the environment (
  e.g., a civilization might arise in river valleys in temperate zones). Some games like *Dwarf Fortress* already
  simulate thousands of years of history on a generated world, including the rise and fall of civilizations and changes
  in the landscape. Future systems could integrate such history simulation tightly with terrain generation, so the
  erosion of rivers and expansion of deserts might partially result from human or magical activities in the world’s
  lore.
- **AI and Machine Learning**: With the rise of machine learning, one could train models on real-world data to generate
  terrain or climate patterns. For example, a neural network could learn from Earth’s topography and produce heightmaps
  that “look Earth-like” but for fictional configurations of continents (this would be akin to style transfer for maps).
  ML could also assist in parameter tuning: procedural generation often involves many parameters (noise roughness, rain
  amount, etc.), and finding sets that produce desired outcomes is an art. An AI could be used to search the parameter
  space for worlds that meet certain criteria (say, a target ratio of biomes, or a desired number of large continents).
  Care would be needed to ensure the AI outputs remain coherent and not just “random-like” outputs.
- **Real-time Planet Generation**: As computing power grows, the holy grail would be *on-the-fly* planet generation that
  players can witness in real time or influence during gameplay (beyond the small-scale editing of Mapgen4). Imagine a
  game where a player’s actions (say a magic spell or a mega-engineering project) cause tectonic shifts or climate
  change and the world generator updates the world accordingly. This would require the generator to be efficient and
  incremental – e.g., recalc climate only for the affected region, or gradually simulate the effects over game years.
  Some research into **interactive procedural modeling** is heading this way, allowing local edits without recomputing
  the whole world .
- **Multi-Scale Detail**: Currently there’s often a gap between large-scale world gen and local-scale terrain detail (
  e.g., individual rocks, small hills). Bridging this could involve using **procedural zoom**: generate the world at a
  coarse scale, then have a finer generator (like Perlin noise or even rule-based generation) add detail as the player
  zooms in or approaches regions. A smooth level-of-detail system would ensure continuity. This way, one could
  potentially have a planet with realistic 100-meter resolution terrain without storing it all at once – detail is
  generated as needed. Some voxel engine games approach this with 3D noise generation on the fly for caves and such. For
  heightmap-based worlds, one could generate a base at 1km resolution and then when needed generate intermediate points
  via fractal refinement.

**Proposed Framework**: Integrating all these, we propose a pipeline:

1. **Initial Layout Generation**: Choose either noise-based or user-specified initial elevation. Perhaps allow the user
   to sketch continents or input parameters (e.g., % ocean).
2. **Plate Tectonics Module**: Simulate plate movements for N iterations. Output: adjusted elevation, plate boundary
   map, mountain stress map.
3. **Erosion Module**: If speed allows, run hydraulic erosion simulation for M iterations or use a pseudo-erosion like
   erosion noise. Output: new elevation, river pathways (vector or raster).
4. **Hydrology Module**: Compute flow accumulation on final terrain, designate rivers and lakes. Maybe adjust river
   depths explicitly (carve beds a bit more).
5. **Climate Module**: Compute insolation by latitude, apply atmospheric model (simplified circulation + orographic
   rain). Output: temperature map, precipitation map.
6. **Sea Current/Ocean module (optional)**: For advanced use, simulate ocean currents as well, which can affect coastal
   climates (warm currents = wetter coasts, etc.). This is rarely done, but a simplified ocean temperature layer could
   be added.
7. **Biome Module**: Classify each land cell into a biome given temp & rainfall. Possibly also check soil moisture (near
   rivers might be more fertile -> different biome).
8. **Civilization/History Module (optional)**: Generate or simulate any world history elements if needed (not terrain
   per se, but could modify terrain, e.g., massive agriculture might turn forest into plains).
9. **Visualization Module**: Render the data to outputs (maps, 3D scenes). This would also handle level-of-detail if
   needed, e.g., fractal refine the heightmap when rendering up close.

Throughout, the system should record meta-data (like plate IDs, watershed IDs, etc.) because these are useful for
downstream applications (game AI, story generation, etc.). For example, knowing plate boundaries helps place volcanoes
or hot springs (WorldEngine explicitly notes using plate boundaries for earthquakes/volcanoes in gameplay ).

By keeping modules separate, users of the system can mix and match. An author might skip the plate module to get a
quicker result, or run climate module with a high-end GCM if they want scientific accuracy.

Finally, validating the world is important – e.g., ensure no “unreachable” high peaks (unless intended), ensure rivers
actually end in the sea or evaporate in deserts (no rivers just stopping arbitrarily), ensure biome transitions make
sense (maybe no abrupt jungle-to-glacier without intervening biomes). A set of logical rules can scan the final world
for such anomalies and adjust or flag them.

The future of fictional world generation is bright: with increasing computing power and algorithmic innovations,
generators are edging closer to replicating the complexity of real planets, yet with control to craft fantastical
variations. By learning from both scientific models and artistic needs, we can build tools that generate entire living
worlds at the push of a button – worlds that **tell a story** through their mountains and rivers, as much as through the
characters that inhabit them.

## Conclusion

Procedural generation of fictional worlds is a rich interdisciplinary field, drawing on computer graphics, geology,
meteorology, and ecology. We have reviewed how noise algorithms lay the groundwork for terrain, how plate tectonics
algorithms give that terrain a meaningful large-scale structure, and how erosion and climate simulations breathe further
life into it by carving rivers and nurturing deserts and forests. Key implementations like WorldEngine and Tectonics.js
embody these principles, and ongoing research continues to close the gap between simulated worlds and reality.

The thesis finds that no single algorithm suffices – it is the **synthesis** of methods that produces the best results.
Fractal noise supplies endless detail, tectonics provides structural realism, erosion adds history and authenticity,
climate and biomes create the environmental diversity expected of a world. By integrating these, one can generate worlds
that are not only visually plausible but internally consistent, with each feature having an explanation in the world’s
simulated natural history. Moreover, with thoughtful data structures (grids, meshes) and careful attention to
performance, these techniques can be made practical for use in games and interactive tools.

We have also proposed a forward-looking framework that embraces modularity and scalability, aiming to accommodate both
rapid prototyping and deep simulation. Future world generators may incorporate machine learning to guide generation or
even simulate the evolution of life and civilizations on the generated world, making the result not just a static map
but a living planet with its own narrative.

In conclusion, fictional world generation stands at the nexus of science and imagination – by understanding and
harnessing real-world processes, we empower creators to conjure up new worlds that feel as rich and dynamic as our own.
The algorithms and techniques discussed here form the foundation on which the next generation of immersive, procedurally
created universes will be built.
