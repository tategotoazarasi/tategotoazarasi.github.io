Dear International Students,

On behalf of the Students' Union, I am delighted to extend a warm welcome to you as you join our university community.

To ensure a smooth transition, we recommend obtaining a local mobile phone number and opening a bank account upon arrival. These will prove invaluable for your daily life in China. Remember to bring your student ID and passport when applying for these services.

Our university offers a wealth of resources and activities to enrich your campus experience. We encourage you to explore student clubs, attend cultural events, and participate in sports activities to make the most of your time here.

Should you have any questions or concerns, please don't hesitate to contact the Students' Union. We are here to support you throughout your journey.

We look forward to meeting you soon!

Best regards,
Li Ming
President, Students' Union
