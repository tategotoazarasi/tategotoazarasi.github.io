The line graph depicts the projected proportion of the population aged 65 and over in Japan, Sweden, and the USA, spanning from 1940 to 2040. It is evident that an aging population is a pervasive trend across these nations, albeit with distinct trajectories.

In the early decades, the USA and Sweden exhibited similar patterns, with the elderly constituting 5-10% of the population in 1940-1960, gradually increasing to 10-15% by 1980. Subsequently, the trajectories diverged, as Sweden's aging population escalated more rapidly, surpassing 20% by 2020, while the USA's figures remained relatively stable until the present day.

Japan's aging population, however, followed a unique path. The proportion of elderly initially declined from 1940 to 1960, potentially due to the impact of World War II. Nevertheless, it began a steady ascent thereafter, though remaining lower than its Western counterparts until the turn of the millennium. A striking feature emerges post-2020, with Japan's aging population projected to surge exponentially, surpassing 25% by 2040 â€“ the highest among the three nations depicted.

While Sweden and the USA are also anticipated to experience a substantial increase in their aging populations after 2020, the escalation in Japan appears unparalleled, reflecting the nation's rapidly graying society and the demographic challenges it will confront in the coming decades.
