The table illustrates data regarding the underground railway systems in six cities, focusing on their opening dates, route lengths, and annual passenger numbers.

Tokyo has the highest number of passengers, with 1927 million per year, followed by Paris with 1191 million. London, despite having the longest route of 394 kilometers, serves 775 million passengers annually. In contrast, Washington DC, with a route length of 126 kilometers, accommodates 144 million passengers annually. Kyoto and Los Angeles, with significantly shorter routes of 11 and 28 kilometers respectively, have the lowest passenger numbers at 45 million and 50 million per year.

The data suggests a correlation between the length of the railway route and passenger numbers. However, Tokyo is an exception, having fewer route kilometers but significantly more passengers than other cities. This discrepancy highlights the potential impact of population density and public transport dependency on passenger numbers.

The opening dates of these systems reflect the historical and economic contexts of their respective regions. London's system, the oldest, dates back to 1863, reflecting early urbanization. Newer systems, like those in Kyoto (1981) and Los Angeles (2001), indicate more recent urban developments. The data implies that both economic capability and population needs drive the development of underground railways.
