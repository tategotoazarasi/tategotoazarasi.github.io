The table presents data on the average distance in miles traveled per person per year in England, categorized by mode of travel, comparing figures from 1985 and 2000.

Overall, the total distance traveled by individuals increased by 36%, from 4,740 miles in 1985 to 6,475 miles in 2000. The most significant increase was observed in car travel, which remained the dominant mode of transport, rising from 3,199 miles to 4,806 miles. Similarly, travel by long-distance bus and train also saw notable increases, with long-distance bus usage more than doubling from 54 miles to 124 miles and train travel rising from 289 miles to 366 miles.

In contrast, the use of local buses saw a sharp decline, decreasing from 429 miles in 1985 to 274 miles in 2000. Modes of travel such as walking and cycling experienced a slight decline, with walking decreasing from 255 miles to 237 miles and cycling from 51 miles to 41 miles. Taxi travel, though still a minor mode, tripled from 13 miles to 42 miles.

In summary, while car travel continued to dominate, the overall pattern of travel modes showed a significant shift towards increased reliance on motorized transport, particularly cars, at the expense of walking, cycling, and local bus usage.
