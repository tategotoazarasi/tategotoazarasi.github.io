The two line graphs illustrate the changes in the percentage of households owning three types of electrical appliances (washing machines, refrigerators, and vacuum cleaners) and the number of hours spent on housework per week in a given country between 1920 and 2019.

Overall, there was a significant increase in the ownership of electrical appliances over the century, with refrigerators and vacuum cleaners becoming universally available. Concurrently, the amount of time spent on housework per household dropped dramatically.

In 1920, only 40% of households had a washing machine, while 30% owned a vacuum cleaner, and virtually none possessed a refrigerator. By 1940, refrigerator ownership surged to 55%, overtaking vacuum cleaners and surpassing washing machines, which rose to 60% during this period. By 1960, refrigerators had achieved the highest ownership rate of the three, reaching 90%, compared to 70% for vacuum cleaners and just under 65% for washing machines. Eventually, by 1980, both refrigerators and vacuum cleaners reached full saturation at 100%, while the proportion of households with washing machines fluctuated slightly, reaching approximately 75% in 2019.

The second graph shows that the number of hours spent on housework per week per household plummeted from 50 hours in 1920 to just 20 hours by 1960. This downward trend continued more gradually, with weekly housework time dropping to 15 hours in 1980 and eventually reaching a low of 10 hours by 2019.
