The bar chart illustrates how families in one country allocated their weekly income across different categories in 1968 and 2018.

Overall, the data reveal significant shifts in spending habits over the 50-year period. In 1968, food accounted for the largest proportion of household expenditure, whereas by 2018, spending on leisure had become the dominant category. Housing and transport costs also saw notable increases.

In 1968, families allocated 35% of their weekly income to food, making it by far the largest expense. However, by 2018, this figure had halved to around 17%. In contrast, expenditure on leisure rose sharply, from under 10% in 1968 to approximately 23% in 2018, overtaking food as the largest spending category. Housing also experienced a significant increase, rising from around 10% to 19% over the same period.

Transport costs doubled, moving from just over 5% in 1968 to 14% in 2018, while spending on clothing and footwear saw a marked decrease, falling from roughly 10% to under 5%. Household goods and fuel & power costs remained relatively stable, hovering around 8% and 5% respectively in both years. Meanwhile, spending on personal goods decreased slightly from 8% to around 4%.

In summary, the most striking changes in family spending patterns between 1968 and 2018 are the substantial reduction in food expenditure and the sharp rise in leisure, housing, and transport costs.
