The bar chart illustrates the coffee and tea consumption habits of residents in five Australian cities—Sydney, Melbourne, Brisbane, Adelaide, and Hobart—over the past four weeks, with data provided on preferences for buying fresh coffee, buying instant coffee, and visiting cafés.

Overall, visiting a café for coffee or tea was the most popular choice in most cities, with a majority of residents opting for this social setting over purchasing coffee for home consumption. Among those who did buy coffee, instant coffee was generally more popular than fresh coffee.

In detail, café attendance was particularly high in Sydney, Melbourne, and Hobart, where approximately 60-65% of residents reported visiting a café. This figure is notably higher than the proportions of residents buying either fresh or instant coffee in these cities. Brisbane also followed this trend, with around 55% choosing to visit a café, though the difference between this and the instant coffee buyers (just under 50%) was less pronounced. Adelaide was the only city where café visits (just below 50%) did not surpass the purchase of instant coffee, with 50% of Adelaide residents opting for the latter.

Regarding fresh coffee purchases, these were consistently lower across all cities, with the highest levels in Sydney and Melbourne (around 44%). In contrast, only 34-38% of residents in Brisbane, Adelaide, and Hobart bought fresh coffee, showing a clear preference for instant coffee in these locations.

In summary, the data indicates a strong preference for social café visits across most cities, with instant coffee as the more popular home option, particularly in Brisbane and Adelaide. Fresh coffee purchases remained comparatively low across all surveyed locations.
