The map illustrates two possible sites for a new supermarket in the town of Garlsdon, which has a population of 65,000. Garlsdon is situated 12 km southeast of Hindon, 16 km northeast of Bransdon, and 25 km northwest of Cransdon. A railway passes through the town center, which is encircled by residential areas, with industrial zones located to the north and south of the center.

Site S1 is located in the countryside to the west of Garlsdon. This site benefits from lower land costs, allowing for a larger supermarket with ample parking space. It is ideal for shoppers who drive, potentially attracting customers from the surrounding areas, including Hindon and Bransdon. However, its distance from the town center may be inconvenient for residents without cars.

Site S2 is situated within the town center, making it more accessible to the majority of Garlsdonâ€™s residents, particularly those who do not drive. Its proximity to the railway station and main roads enhances its convenience. However, the higher cost of land in the town center may result in a smaller supermarket with less parking space, and potentially higher prices for consumers.

In conclusion, the choice between Site S1 and Site S2 depends on whether the priority is to cater to drivers and attract customers from neighboring towns or to serve the local population more conveniently. Each site offers distinct advantages that should be carefully considered in the planning process.
