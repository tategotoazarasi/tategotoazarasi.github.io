The table illustrates the total number of US cruise passengers in 1995 and 2005, while the bar chart breaks down the percentages of these passengers in different age groups who purchased travel insurance.

Overall, there was a substantial increase in the number of US cruise passengers over the ten-year period, and a higher percentage of passengers across all age groups bought insurance in 2005 than in 1995. Older passengers consistently had a higher likelihood of buying travel insurance than younger ones.

In detail, the number of US cruise passengers rose dramatically from 397,837 in 1995 to 3,569,251 in 2005, nearly a ninefold increase. The percentage of passengers with travel insurance also rose significantly across all age groups, with younger passengers showing the most notable growth. For example, only 3% of those aged 18-28 purchased insurance in 1995, but this figure climbed to about 10% in 2005. Similarly, the proportion of insured passengers in the 29-39 and 40-50 age groups increased from around 8% to 17% and from approximately 10% to 22%, respectively.

Older age groups exhibited consistently high insurance purchase rates, with those aged 62-72 and 73-83 showing the most substantial proportions. By 2005, nearly 50% of passengers in the 62-72 age group and about 55% in the 73-83 group had bought insurance, compared to around 36% and 40%, respectively, in 1995.

In summary, the data reveal that both the popularity of cruising and the purchase of travel insurance grew significantly between 1995 and 2005, with older age groups continuing to show a higher preference for insurance.
