Creative artists should indeed be given the freedom to express their ideas in words, pictures, music, or film. However, I believe that there should be some government restrictions on what they do to ensure a balanced society.

Firstly, freedom of expression is a fundamental human right, and it is essential for the flourishing of creativity and innovation. Everyone, including artists, should have the freedom to express themselves. However, this freedom is not absolute and should not infringe on the rights and freedoms of others. Laws are established to ensure that freedom is exercised responsibly and fairly. Therefore, artists, like any other citizens, should not have privileges that place them above the law.

For instance, many street artists create murals on public walls. While their work can beautify urban spaces, it is crucial that they obtain permission from property owners before painting. Without such permissions, their actions would be illegal. Moreover, different countries have varying regulations regarding the content of expression. For example, displaying Nazi symbols is illegal in Germany, and depicting nudity is prohibited in most Islamic countries, whereas such expressions might be legal elsewhere. Whether these regulations are reasonable is subject to debate, but artists must abide by the law to prevent societal chaos. If artists were exempt from legal restrictions, it would raise questions about who qualifies as an artist and could hinder aspiring artists who might face undue scrutiny.

In conclusion, while creative artists should have the freedom to express their ideas, this freedom must have limitations imposed by the law. Complete absence of government restrictions could lead to disorder and inequity, and thus, I disagree with the notion that there should be no government oversight on artistic expression.
