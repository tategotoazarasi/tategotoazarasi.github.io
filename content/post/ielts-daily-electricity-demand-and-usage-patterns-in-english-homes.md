The line graph displays typical daily electricity demand patterns in England for winter and summer days. The pie chart breaks down the main uses of electricity in the average English home.

Looking at the graph, there are two clear peaks in electricity demand each day, corresponding to the morning and evening periods of highest household activity. However, the morning peak is considerably higher in winter, reaching nearly 40,000 units compared to around 25,000 units in summer. This can likely be attributed to greater energy needs for heating homes and water when temperatures are colder. The evening peaks are more similar across seasons, though still moderately higher in winter.

Turning to the pie chart, it shows that by far the largest drain on electricity for English households is heating, which accounts for over half (52.5%) of usage for warming rooms and water. The next highest segments are cooking appliances like ovens and kettles (17.5%), as well as lighting, TV and radios (15%). An equivalent 15% share goes towards powering smaller household equipment like vacuum cleaners, mixers and tools.

In summary, while warming needs drive substantially higher winter electricity demands, especially in the morning, there are consistent daily usage patterns year-round. Heating dominates residential power consumption, followed by kitchen appliances, lighting/entertainment, and small household devices.
