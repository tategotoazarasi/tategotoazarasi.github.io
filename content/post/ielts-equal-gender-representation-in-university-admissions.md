I strongly disagree with implementing a regulation that mandates equal numbers of male and female students in every subject in universities.

First and foremost, it is indeed true that gender proportions vary across different subjects. Gender inequality in education does exist, and it is a significant problem rooted in family and societal norms. Many people still harbor stereotypes and discriminatory beliefs, such as the notion that girls cannot be engineers. However, imposing a gender quota on university admissions will not address the root causes of this issue.

Boys and girls do not possess inherent intellectual differences, but after 18 years of life and education, they often develop different interests and abilities, albeit these differences may result from societal biases. Enforcing equal gender representation in every subject would likely lead to a decline in the overall quality of students. Admitting students based solely on gender quotas rather than merit would statistically result in poorer performance, reinforcing the stereotype that one gender is less capable in certain subjects. Moreover, students who lose their opportunity due to such policies will likely become disillusioned and may develop reactionary attitudes towards gender equality.

The struggle against educational inequality and societal stereotypes is a long and arduous one, potentially spanning generations. Therefore, I cannot support such a simplistic solution. Universities should admit students based solely on their talents and abilities. Once we address the deeper, underlying issues of gender discrimination, the number of male and female students in every subject will naturally and statistically equalize.
