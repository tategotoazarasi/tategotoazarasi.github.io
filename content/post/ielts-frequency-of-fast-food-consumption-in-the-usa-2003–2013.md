The bar chart illustrates the percentage of Americans who ate at fast food restaurants with varying frequencies across three years: 2003, 2006, and 2013.

In summary, the majority of Americans consumed fast food on a weekly or bi-monthly basis during this period, with these categories showing fluctuations over time. Meanwhile, the least common frequencies were eating every day or never eating at all, which remained consistently low throughout the decade.

In detail, in 2003, around 31% of people ate at fast food restaurants once a week, and this figure rose slightly to 33% in 2006 before dropping to 27% in 2013. Similarly, those who visited fast food establishments once or twice a month constituted 30% in 2003, decreased to 25% in 2006, and then peaked at 33% in 2013, becoming the most common frequency that year.

On the other hand, individuals eating several times a week accounted for approximately 20% in 2003, increased marginally to 20% in 2006, and then dropped to 15% by 2013. The proportion of those who ate either daily or never hovered between 3-5% over the entire decade, showing minimal fluctuation. The percentage of people eating fast food a few times a year remained relatively stable, staying close to 15% throughout the period.
