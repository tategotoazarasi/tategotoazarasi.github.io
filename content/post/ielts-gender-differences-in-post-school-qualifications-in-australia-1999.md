The chart illustrates the different levels of post-school qualifications in Australia in 1999, categorized by gender. Overall, it shows that males and females tend to pursue different types of qualifications.

In terms of skilled vocational diplomas, a significant majority of the holders are males, accounting for about 90%, while only 10% are females. This suggests that men were much more likely to pursue vocational training than women.

For undergraduate diplomas, the trend is reversed, with females representing approximately 70% of the qualification holders, compared to 30% of males. Similarly, women slightly outnumber men in holding bachelor's degrees, with around 55% to 45% respectively.

At the postgraduate level, males again take the lead. About 70% of postgraduate diploma holders are males, whereas females account for 30%. The disparity is also evident in masterâ€™s degrees, where males make up about 60%, and females about 40%.

In conclusion, the data indicates that in 1999, women in Australia were more likely to hold undergraduate qualifications, whereas men were more dominant in vocational training and postgraduate studies. This suggests a gender-based difference in the pursuit of higher education and vocational training during that period.
