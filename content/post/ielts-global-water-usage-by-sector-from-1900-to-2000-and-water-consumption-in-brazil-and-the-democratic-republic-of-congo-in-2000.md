The graph illustrates global water usage in three sectors—agriculture, industrial, and domestic—from 1900 to 2000, while the table compares water consumption between Brazil and the Democratic Republic of Congo in 2000.

Over the century, global water usage in all three sectors increased significantly, with agriculture consuming the most water throughout the period. Agricultural water use rose sharply from approximately 500 km³ in 1900 to around 3,000 km³ by 2000, a sixfold increase. Industrial water use also saw a notable rise, particularly after 1950, reaching approximately 1,000 km³ by 2000. Domestic water consumption, while increasing, remained the lowest among the three sectors, reaching about 500 km³ by the end of the century.

The table highlights significant differences in water consumption between Brazil and Congo in 2000. Brazil, with a population of 176 million, had a per capita water consumption of 359 m³, far exceeding Congo’s 8 m³ per person. Additionally, Brazil had 26,500 km² of irrigated land compared to Congo’s 100 km². This disparity in water usage reflects both the larger population and the more extensive agricultural infrastructure in Brazil.

Overall, the data indicate a growing global demand for water, especially in agriculture, and reveal stark contrasts in water consumption between Brazil and Congo.
