The diagram illustrates the process of generating electricity using geothermal energy in a power plant. The entire operation consists of five main stages, beginning with the injection of cold water into the earth and culminating in the production of electricity.

Initially, cold water is pumped down through a 4.5-kilometre pipe to the injection well, where it reaches the geothermal zone. In this zone, the water is heated as it flows through the hot rocks deep beneath the surface. Once the water becomes sufficiently heated, it moves upward through the production well and returns to the surface.

Next, the hot water enters the condenser, where it undergoes a transformation into steam. This steam is then directed into a turbine, causing it to spin. The rotating turbine generates mechanical energy, which is subsequently converted into electrical energy by the connected generator. Finally, the electricity produced is transmitted to the power grid for public use.

In summary, the process of generating electricity from geothermal energy involves a series of steps that utilize natural heat from beneath the Earth's surface to convert water into steam, which then powers the turbine and generator to produce electricity.
