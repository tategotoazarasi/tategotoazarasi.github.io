The line graph illustrates the number of tourists who visited a specific Caribbean island between 2010 and 2017, differentiating between those who stayed on the island, those who stayed on cruise ships, and the total number of visitors.

Overall, the total number of tourists visiting the island rose significantly over this period, increasing from 1 million in 2010 to 3.5 million by 2017. Notably, while tourists initially preferred to stay on the island, the number of visitors choosing to stay on cruise ships grew rapidly and eventually surpassed those staying on the island.

In 2010, the total number of visitors was 1 million, with around 0.75 million opting to stay on the island and 0.25 million choosing cruise ships. From 2011 to 2015, both groups of visitors experienced growth, although the number of cruise-ship tourists fluctuated slightly, dipping to 0.25 million in 2012 before steadily rising to reach 1.5 million in 2015. In contrast, the number of visitors staying on the island increased steadily to 1.5 million by 2013 and then stabilized around this level for the rest of the period.

From 2015 onwards, visitors on cruise ships continued to increase, reaching 2 million in 2017, while those staying on the island remained constant at approximately 1.5 million. By 2017, the total number of tourists peaked at 3.5 million, marking a substantial rise compared to the beginning of the period.
