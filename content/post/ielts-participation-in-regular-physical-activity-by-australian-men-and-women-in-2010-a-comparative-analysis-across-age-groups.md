The bar chart illustrates the percentage of Australian men and women across six different age groups who participated in regular physical activity in 2010.

Overall, women tended to be more physically active than men in the majority of age groups, except for the youngest group (15 to 24 years), where men had a higher participation rate. Men's participation generally decreased with age before rising again in the older age groups, while women's participation increased steadily before declining slightly in the oldest age bracket.

In detail, among those aged 15 to 24, 52.8% of men engaged in regular physical activity, compared to 47.7% of women. However, this trend reversed in the 25 to 34 age group, where 48.9% of women exercised regularly, slightly higher than the 42.2% of men. The lowest participation rate for men occurred in the 35 to 44 age group at 39.5%, while women in the same age group had a higher rate of 52.5%.

From the age of 45 to 54, women's participation reached a peak of 53.3%, whereas men's participation began to increase after the previous decline, reaching 43.1%. In the 55 to 64 age group, 53% of women remained active compared to 45.1% of men. Finally, in the 65 and over category, the participation rates were almost equal, with 46.7% of men and 47.1% of women engaging in regular physical activity.

In conclusion, while men's participation in physical activity followed a fluctuating pattern, women's rates generally rose until middle age, after which they gradually declined.
