The two maps depict the current layout of Islip town centre and the proposed development plan. Overall, significant changes will occur in the infrastructure, with a focus on expanding facilities and improving transportation within the town centre.

At present, Islip town centre is bisected by a main road running from west to east, with shops lining both sides. To the north lies open countryside, while residential housing is concentrated in the southern part of the town, between a school to the west and a park to the east.

According to the proposed development plan, the main road will be converted into a pedestrian-only street, and a dual carriageway will encircle the town centre, providing access to various new facilities. The northern side of the town, currently occupied by shops, will be replaced by a bus station, a shopping centre, a car park, and additional housing. In contrast, the southern part of the centre will retain its residential character, although new housing will be built adjacent to the park, which remains in its original location.

In summary, the future development of Islip town centre will transform the area into a more modern and accessible urban space, with enhanced public services and a completely revamped road system.
