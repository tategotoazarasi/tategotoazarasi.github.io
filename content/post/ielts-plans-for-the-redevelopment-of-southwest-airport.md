The diagrams illustrate the current layout of Southwest Airport and the planned changes after its redevelopment.

Currently, the airport has a straightforward layout, with separate departure and arrival sections. In the departures area, passengers first go through the check-in counters and a café before proceeding to passport control and security. After these formalities, they reach a terminal with eight gates, which can be accessed via a walkway. The arrivals section consists of passport control and customs, with a simple exit through the arrivals lounge.

After redevelopment, the airport will see significant changes, particularly in its size and available facilities. The departures area will be enhanced with a new bag drop section, and shops will be added along the route from security to the gates. The terminal will be expanded from a straight line into a Y-shape, accommodating 18 gates, accessible by a sky train instead of a walkway. In the arrivals area, additional amenities such as a café, ATM, and car hire services will be introduced, improving the passenger experience.

In summary, the redevelopment will significantly expand the airport’s capacity and improve its facilities, making it more suitable for handling a larger volume of passengers.
