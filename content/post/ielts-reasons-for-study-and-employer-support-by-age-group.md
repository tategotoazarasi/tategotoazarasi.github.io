The first chart illustrates the main reasons for study among students of different age groups, while the second chart depicts the level of support these students receive from their employers, in terms of time off and financial assistance.

The initial chart reveals a clear trend: the proportion of students studying for career-related reasons declines with age. Specifically, 80% of students under 26 study for career purposes, compared to only around 20% of those over 49. Conversely, the motivation to study out of personal interest increases significantly with age, with the oldest group (over 49) showing the highest percentage of interest-driven study.

In the second graph, the level of employer support follows a varied pattern. Younger employees (under 26) receive the highest level of support at approximately 60%. This support decreases to about 50% for the 26-29 age group and reaches its lowest point (30%) among those aged 30-39. However, the support begins to rise again, reaching 40% for the oldest group (over 49).

Overall, younger students predominantly study for career advancement and receive more employer support, while older students are more likely to pursue education for personal interest and experience fluctuating levels of employer support.
