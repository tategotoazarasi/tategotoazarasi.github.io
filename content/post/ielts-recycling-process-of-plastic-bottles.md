The diagram illustrates the nine-step process used to recycle plastic bottles and transform them into new consumer products.

Initially, people dispose of plastic bottles in designated recycling bins marked with a recycling symbol. These bins are then collected by trucks, which transport the bottles to a recycling center. At the center, the bottles undergo manual sorting on a conveyor belt, where they are separated into recyclable and non-recyclable categories.

Once sorted, the recyclable bottles are compressed into large blocks, which are subsequently crushed into smaller pieces by a crushing machine. The crushed plastic pieces are then thoroughly washed in a water tank to remove impurities. After cleaning, the pieces are fed into a machine that transforms them into small plastic pellets. These pellets are then heated and melted to create raw plastic material.

Finally, the raw material is molded into various end products, such as new plastic bottles, bags, clothing items, and stationery products like pencils.

In summary, this nine-stage process effectively converts discarded plastic bottles into useful new products, contributing to environmental sustainability.
