In the remote alpine village of Zinren, life is a constant uphill **battle**. The villagers must **dribble** down the treacherous mountain paths just to fetch water from the  streams. During the bitterly cold winters, their only defence against  frostbite is to keep an eagle eye on the **thermometer** and layer up with extra **cushions**. Merely surviving at such high altitudes is a **formidable** task.

在偏远的高山村庄Zinren，生活是一场不断的**攀登**挑战。村民们必须小心翼翼地沿着危险的山路**运送**水流，仅为从溪流中取水。在严冬寒冷的季节里，他们唯一的防寒措施就是密切关注**温度计**，并额外添上几层**垫子**。在这样高的海拔上仅仅生存就是一项**艰巨**的任务。

One's **temperament** is certainly tested by the harshness of these conditions. Minor disagreements can quickly escalate into heated **squabbles** or even full-blown **brawls**. Neighbours have been known to **topple** over the edge into feuds lasting years over something as trivial as a misplaced **shipment** of supplies.

严酷的环境肯定会考验一个人的**性情**。微小的分歧很快就能升级成激烈的**争吵**或甚至彻底的**斗殴**。众所周知，邻里之间因为一些小如误送的**货物**而争执，可以演变成持续多年的深仇大恨。

Living in such an unforgiving environment requires a **paramount** level of resilience and cooperation. The village blessing ceremony, where newborns are **christened** and given their names, is seen as a sacred rite to **impersonate** the ideal of unity. All must pull together like a well-oiled piece of alpine **machinery**.

在这种无情的环境中生活，需要具备**至高无上**的韧性和合作精神。村庄的祝福仪式，新生儿在此被**命名**，并给予他们的名字，被视为**扮演**团结理想的神圣仪式。所有人必须像一台精密的高山**机械**一样齐心协力。

While the village may seem bleak to an outsider, the Zinrenese view their home with immense **pride**. They take great **pride** in their world-renowned woolens, an **assortment** of luxuriously warm sweaters, hats and mittens. The beauty of the **spire**-topped peaks is unmatched, and on clear nights the stars provide a dazzling celestial **appraisal**.

虽然对外人来说，这个村庄可能看起来很凄凉，但Zinren的居民对自己的家园充满了强烈的**自豪**。他们为自己闻名世界的羊毛制品深感**骄傲**，这些羊毛制品是一系列极为温暖的毛衣、帽子和手套的**混合物**。那些顶端尖**塔**的山峰美不胜收，晴朗夜晚的星空提供了令人惊叹的天体**评价**。

The heartiest of Zinrenese children **dribble** a handmade ball through the streets, **blistering** their hands in the process as they play the time-honored sport of goatball. It is an intense **sport**, demanding **athleticism** and perseverance. The best players are able to effortlessly **overturn** and misdirect opponents with fancy footwork.

最为坚韧的Zinren孩子们在街头**运球**，在玩古老的山羊球运动时**磨破**了手。这是一项激烈的**运动**，需要**运动能力**和毅力。最优秀的球员能够轻松地**颠倒**对手，用巧妙的脚法使对手方向错误。

While a peaceful night's sleep can be hard to come by due to the thin air, most locals **pronounce** themselves well-rested after nights in Zinren. Perhaps their ability to sleep soundly is aided by the comfort of being part of such a tightknit and **pro**-village **community**.

虽然由于空气稀薄，平静的夜晚的睡眠可能难以得到，但大多数当地人都会**宣称**在Zinren的夜晚之后他们休息得很好。也许他们能够安然入睡，是因为他们是如此紧密和支持**村庄**的**社群**的一部分。
