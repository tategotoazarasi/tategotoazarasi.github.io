In recent years, marine biologists have been sounding the alarm about the **sluggish** progress in ocean conservation efforts. Despite the **roughly** 71% of Earth's surface covered by water, our understanding of marine  ecosystems remains incomplete. This lack of knowledge has led to  practices that **run counter to** preservation goals, **scattering** marine life and disrupting delicate balances.

近年来，海洋生物学家一直在敲响警钟，警告海洋保护工作进展**缓慢**。尽管地球表面**大约**有71%被水覆盖，我们对海洋生态系统的了解仍然不完全。这种知识的缺乏导致了**与**保护目标**背道而驰**的做法，**分散**了海洋生物，破坏了脆弱的平衡。

The **keeper** of marine biodiversity, coral reefs, face unprecedented threats. Rising sea temperatures **exert** pressure on these fragile ecosystems, causing coral bleaching and death. Scientists observe with **gaping** mouths as once-vibrant reefs are reduced to **tatters**, their skeletal remains a stark reminder of human impact. Conservationists argue that we must **step out** of our comfort zones and take decisive action before it's too late.

作为海洋生物多样性的**守护者**，珊瑚礁面临前所未有的威胁。海水温度的上升**施加**了压力，使这些脆弱的生态系统面临珊瑚白化和死亡的危险。科学家们**瞠目**结舌地看着曾经生机勃勃的珊瑚礁变成**破碎**的残骸，它们的骨架残骸是人类影响的鲜明提醒。环保主义者认为，我们必须**走出**舒适区，采取果断行动，才能在为时已晚之前有所作为。

Efforts to **soak up** knowledge about marine life have intensified. Researchers in **denim** overalls brave choppy waters, using specialized equipment to study various species. They **cut through** waves in small boats, using **oars** when engines might disturb wildlife. Buoys **mark out** areas of interest, while underwater cameras capture the behavior of  creatures in their natural habitat. However, progress is often hindered  by **uptight** regulations and insufficient funding.

**吸收**关于海洋生物的知识的努力在不断加剧。身穿**牛仔布**工作服的研究人员冒着波涛汹涌的海水，用专业设备研究各种物种。他们乘坐小船**切开**波浪，当发动机会打扰野生动物时，他们使用**桨**划船。浮标**标记出**感兴趣的区域，水下摄像机记录下生物在自然栖息地中的行为。然而，进展常常被**严格**的法规和资金不足所阻碍。

The **verbal** battles between environmentalists and industry representatives often **temper** enthusiasm for conservation. Fishing companies **flaunt** their economic importance, arguing that strict regulations would **suffocate** their business. However, marine **therapists** working to rehabilitate injured sea creatures paint a different picture. They witness firsthand the **malignant** effects of overfishing and pollution. Plastic waste, often in **chunks**, entangles marine life and pollutes their habitats. The sight of a **vulture** circling above a beach strewn with debris is a somber reminder of the interconnectedness of ecosystems.

环保主义者与行业代表之间的**口头**争斗常常**削弱**了保护的热情。渔业公司**炫耀**他们的重要经济地位，认为严格的法规会**窒息**他们的业务。然而，致力于康复受伤海洋生物的海洋**治疗师**则描绘了另一幅图景。他们亲眼目睹了过度捕捞和污染的**恶性**影响。塑料废物，常常成**块**，缠绕海洋生物，污染它们的栖息地。一只**秃鹰**在满是垃圾的海滩上盘旋的景象，是生态系统相互关联的严肃提醒。

**After all**, the future of our oceans is **correlated with** our own survival. The **shattered** state of many marine habitats calls for immediate action. We must **muffle** the voices of skepticism and prioritize conservation efforts. From the  smallest plankton to the largest whales, each species plays a crucial  role in the ocean's delicate balance. As we **furrow** our brows in concentration, searching for solutions, we must remember that time is of the essence. The **scrawl** of hasty signatures on international agreements must be transformed  into concrete actions. Only then can we hope to preserve the rich **denominations** of marine life for future generations.

**毕竟**，海洋的未来与我们的生存**息息相关**。许多海洋栖息地的**破碎**状态需要立即行动。我们必须**压制**怀疑的声音，优先考虑保护工作。从最小的浮游生物到最大的鲸鱼，每个物种在海洋的微妙平衡中都起着至关重要的作用。当我们**皱着**眉头集中精力寻找解决方案时，我们必须记住时间紧迫。国际协议上**潦草**的签名必须转化为具体的行动。只有这样，我们才能希望为子孙后代保留丰富的海洋生物**种类**。
