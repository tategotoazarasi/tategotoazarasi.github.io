In a remote forest region, a research team had been **located in** a reserve **forageing** for insights into chimpanzee behavior. Their work, though of immense **merit**, was frequently **in dispute** due to unconventional methods. Dr. Amanda Richards led this team, which had made many breakthroughs by observing the apes' complex social  dynamics and ritualistic **frolics**.

在一个偏远的森林区域，一支研究团队**位于**保护区内**寻找**有关黑猩猩行为的见解。他们的工作虽然有很大**价值**，但由于方法不寻常，经常**有争议**。阿曼达·理查兹博士领导这支团队，通过观察这些猿类复杂的社会动态和仪式性的**嬉戏**取得了许多突破。

One morning, Richards awoke to a **shambles** at the camp - computer equipment strewn about, chairs and tables overturned. "Another **tantrum** from Reginald last night, I presume," she remarked to her assistant. Reginald was an unusually **crude** older chimpanzee who seemed to **fester** an intense dislike for technology.

一天早晨，理查兹醒来发现营地一片**混乱**——电脑设备被扔得到处都是，椅子和桌子被翻倒了。“我猜又是昨晚雷金纳德的**发脾气**了，”她对助手说。雷金纳德是一只异常**粗暴**的老年黑猩猩，他似乎对科技**滋生**了强烈的厌恶。

As Richards surveyed the damage, she noticed sparse **stubble** on Reginald's balding head and a peculiar **waddle** to his gait - behavioral quirks consistent with his advanced age. A **drip** of water from a leaky **mast** provided the only **diversion** from the chaotic scene.

当理查兹查看损坏情况时，她注意到雷金纳德秃顶的头上稀疏的**胡茬**，以及他走路时奇怪的**摇摆**——这些都是他年迈的行为特征。漏水**桅杆**上的一**滴**水成为了混乱场景中唯一的**消遣**。

"We cannot simply **find fault with** Reginald," said Richards. "We must strive to **envisage** his perspective, even if his actions **perplex** us. The apes did not choose this **suspension** of freedom that captivity imposes."

“我们不能简单地**责怪**雷金纳德，”理查兹说。“我们必须努力**设想**他的角度，即使他的行为让我们**困惑**。猿类并没有选择这种由囚禁带来的**自由悬置**。”

Pondering a solution, her eyes fell upon some **tacky** horoscope pages, a **flap** of magazine **dabs** that had **unfortunately** been left within Reginald's reach. She couldn't help but **talk nonsense** about the very notion of anthropomorphizing zodiac predictions onto primates. Yet, she realized this **crude** interest in human affairs may offer a unique **diversion** to placate him.

在思考解决办法时，她的目光落在一些**俗气的**星座页面上，那是一**页**杂志的**小块**，**不幸**地被留在雷金纳德的可及范围内。她不禁**胡扯**地谈论起将人类的星座预测强加于灵长类动物的荒谬性。然而，她意识到这种对人类事务的**粗陋**兴趣可能提供一种独特的**消遣**，以安抚他。

"We shall **take care** to leave more magazine **dabs** about - perhaps he'll **trade on** this curiosity with more peaceful behavior." Her assistant was skeptical but agreed it was worth a try to **come at** the problem innovatively.

“我们要**小心**多留一些杂志的**小块**——也许他会**利用**这种好奇心来换取更和平的行为。”她的助手虽然持怀疑态度，但同意这是一个值得尝试的创新方法来**应对**这个问题。
