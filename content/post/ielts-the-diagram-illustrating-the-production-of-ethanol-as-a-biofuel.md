The diagram illustrates the process of producing ethanol, a type of biofuel, from plants and trees, as well as its subsequent combustion and reintegration into the cycle of energy production.

The process begins with plants and trees absorbing sunlight and carbon dioxide to grow. Once mature, they are harvested by machinery and sent for pre-processing, where plant matter is converted into cellulose. This cellulose is then further processed in laboratories, breaking it down into simpler sugars. At this stage, microbes are added to the sugars, initiating a fermentation process that produces ethanol.

Once ethanol is ready, it is used as fuel for various modes of transport, such as cars, trucks, and airplanes. During combustion, ethanol releases carbon dioxide back into the atmosphere. This carbon dioxide is subsequently absorbed by plants during photosynthesis, thereby completing the cycle.

In summary, the production of ethanol involves several stages, from harvesting plants to fermentation. The cycle is sustainable, as the carbon dioxide emitted during combustion is reused in plant growth.
