The pie chart illustrates the distribution of dance class locations for young people in an Australian town, while the bar chart compares the number of participants in three dance styles across two age groups: under 11 and 11–16.

Overall, private studios are the most commonly used venues for dance classes, followed by school halls. Regarding dance styles, ballet is significantly more popular among children under 11, while modern dance attracts more teenagers aged 11–16.

Private studios host nearly half (48%) of all dance classes, making them the most preferred location. School halls account for 24%, representing the second most popular choice. Community halls and other venues comprise 18%, while college-based studios, at only 10%, are the least utilized.

In terms of dance styles, 600 children under 11 attend ballet classes, which is twice the number of participants in the 11–16 age group. Participation in tap dance is relatively balanced, with over 400 attendees in each age category. By contrast, modern dance classes are significantly more popular among teenagers, with over 500 participants aged 11–16 compared to just 300 from the younger age group.

In summary, the data indicates a clear preference for private studios as venues and highlights distinct age-based trends in the popularity of ballet and modern dance.
