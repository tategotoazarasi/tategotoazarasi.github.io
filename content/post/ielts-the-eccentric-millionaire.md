In the quaint village of Willowvale, a **prospectus** of an obscure private university landed on the doorsteps one spring  morning. It promised a revolutionary teaching approach - focusing on  character development rather than solely academic subjects. This curious document was the brainchild of Montgomery Fortescue, a retired tycoon  with an **enthusiasm for** offbeat ideas and a **cunning** mind.

在威洛韦尔这个古朴的小村庄里，一个**招股说明书**突然在春天的某个早晨出现在家家户户的门前。它承诺了一种革命性的教学方法——注重人格发展而不仅仅是学术科目。这份奇特的文件是蒙哥马利·福特斯丘的心血之作，他是一位退休的富豪，对离奇的想法有着**热情**，并且拥有一个**狡猾**的头脑。

Fortescue had amassed his fortune through savvy investments, but his  true passion was literature. In his youth, he had been labeled **precocious** for his love of **verse** and **embroidery**. Now, at 68, he remained somewhat **mischievous**. His latest **vogue** was opening an institute to nurture creativity and non-conformist thinking.

福特斯丘通过精明的投资积累了财富，但他的真正热情是文学。在他年轻的时候，因为对**诗歌**和**刺绣**的热爱，他被贴上了**早熟**的标签。现在，68岁的他依然有些**顽皮**。他最新的**时尚**是开办一所培养创造力和非传统思维的学院。

The ivory-towered citadels of learning filled him with **dreary** musings. He believed their curricula too **stagnant**, harboring a **grudge** against the system's rigidity. So he purchased an overgrown **meadow** on Willowvale's outskirts to construct his idyllic campus, aiming to foster brilliance without unnecessary **complications**.

那些象牙塔里的学术堡垒让他感到**沉闷**。他认为它们的课程过于**停滞**，对系统的僵化抱有**怨恨**。于是，他购买了威洛韦尔郊外的一片杂草丛生的**草地**，准备在这里建造他理想中的校园，旨在不受**复杂**束缚地培养人才。

Students would experience an unconventional schedule. Morning **strolls** through wildflower fields were mandatory to "**come to life**" before lessons. Socratic debates under ancient oaks replaced lectures,  and evaluation came through spirited discourse rather than exams. **Notably**, Fortescue banned clocks, for "what better way to **squander** potential than obsessing over the **remainder** of transient time?"

学生们将体验一种非常规的时间表。早晨的**漫步**在野花田中是必修课，目的是在上课前“**苏醒过来**”。在古老的橡树下进行的苏格拉底式辩论取代了传统的讲座，评估通过热烈的讨论而不是考试来进行。**值得注意的是**，福特斯丘禁止使用时钟，因为“还有什么比**浪费**时间的**剩余**更能**消磨**潜力呢？”

He even planned quirks like installing **corks** instead of bells, and **slings** rather than chairs to instill creativity. The eccentric founder would  sometimes prowl about in a jester's cap or stride across campus leading a **fugitive** emu adopted as the school's mascot.

他甚至计划了一些怪招，比如安装**软木塞**代替铃声，使用**吊床**而不是椅子来激发创造力。这位古怪的创始人有时会戴着弄臣的帽子在校园里徘徊，或者牵着一只被收养为校吉祥物的**逃亡**鸸鹋在校园里漫步。

Fortescue ignored **superstitious** locals' murmurings about his **psychological** state. Though his ideas seemed outlandish, he hoped pupils would view the world as he did - appreciating **pin**-drop moments of beauty amid seemingly mundane settings and drawing **sour** inspirations from unexpected places, like the pungent **herring** wafts from the village smokehouse.

福特斯丘无视**迷信的**当地人对他**心理**状态的窃窃私语。虽然他的想法显得离奇，但他希望学生们能像他一样看待这个世界——在看似平凡的环境中欣赏**针**落般的美好时刻，并从意想不到的地方，如村庄熏鱼厂的浓烈**鲱鱼**气味中，汲取**酸涩**的灵感。

When his academy's heavy oak doors opened, the first cohort of  self-styled "Fortescuans" arrived – a spirited, motley crew of  contrarians, firebrands, and visionaries **with caution** tossed to the wind. The founder's inaugural address inspired them to **look into** their talents without fear of **faltering** or society's cynical **flinches**. He urged them to push boundaries, **take a toll on** conformity's weary soul, and resist the urge to ever **waive** their quests for paradigm shifts.

当他的学院厚重的橡木门打开时，第一批自称“福特斯丘人”的学生们抵达了——一群充满活力、形形色色的反叛者、激进分子和愿景家，他们把**谨慎**抛诸脑后。这位创始人的首次演讲激励他们**探究**自己的才能，不畏**动摇**或社会的冷嘲热讽。他鼓励他们打破常规，对常规的疲惫灵魂**造成伤害**，并抵制任何**放弃**追求范式转变的冲动。

In my second decade teaching at Willowvale, I've witnessed those first Fortescuans **tell about** their alma mater **in the course of** launching world-changing enterprises. The visionary founder may have  departed, but his unyielding legacy of fostering creative thought still  reverberates through our hallowed meadows.

在我在威洛韦尔教授的第二个十年里，我见证了那些最早的福特斯丘人**讲述**他们的母校**在...过程中**启动改变世界的企业。尽管这位有远见的创始人已经离世，但他培养创造性思维的坚定遗产依然在我们神圣的草地上回响。
