Deep in the folds of the rural Scottish Highlands, a **fawn** lay curled beneath the **stubble** of last year's harvest, seeking **respite** from the **drizzle** falling in a steady patter. Though **apprehensive** at every sound, the young deer found solace in the **frugal** but lush landscape, where hints of **saffron** tinged the swaying grasses.

在苏格兰高地的乡村褶皱深处，一只小**鹿**蜷缩在去年收割后留下的**茬根**下，寻找从持续细雨中的**喘息**。尽管对每一个声音都感到**忧虑**，这只年轻的鹿在**朴素**但郁郁葱葱的景色中找到了安慰，摇曳的草丛中透出一抹**藏红花色**。

An **illiterate** farmer, more accustomed to judging the weather by the aches in his joints than by any **barometer**, muttered a string of grunts as he steered his barge-like tractor in a **zigzag** across the fields. Unaware of the **horrid measles** afflicting his youngest son, his mind was preoccupied by thoughts of the **bland** but **applicable** advances in fertilizer propagated by the periodicals he paid little heed.

一位**文盲**农民，更习惯于通过关节的疼痛而非任何**气压计**来判断天气，他一边开着像**驳船**一样的拖拉机在田间**之字形**前行，一边发出一串**咕哝**声。他没有意识到自己最小的儿子正受到**可怕的麻疹**的折磨，他的脑海中全是对那些他几乎不**关注**的期刊宣扬的**平淡**但**适用**的肥料新进展的思考。

A flying **cork** from a **sensational** celebration startled the **fawn**, whose white-spotted coat was now clearly visible against the **spectrum** of autumnal hues. The source of the revelry? A **distress** signal sent by the **procession** of lorries delivering this year's **awesome** whiskey yield. No **pretext** was needed – even the dourest of Presbyterian elders felt a **tingle** of joy at such a bountiful harvest.

一个从**激动人心**的庆祝活动中飞出的**软木塞**惊吓了**鹿**，它那斑点斑点的白色外衣现在在秋色的**光谱**中清晰可见。庆典的来源？由运送今年**令人敬畏**的威士忌收成的车队发出的**求救**信号。不需要任何**借口**——即使是最严肃的长老们也感到一阵**悸动**，因为这样的丰收而欣喜。

Chaos reigned as the carousing workers, well past the bounds of  respectable conduct, irrespective of the threats from their  superintendent, scattered across the valley. One paused near the shrub  concealing the fawn, his face a mask of wonder at the natural splendor  surrounding him. For that moment, the boundaries between man and nature  blurred, and all was at peace in the **picturesque** glen.

当欢庆的工人们，完全不顾来自上司的威胁，纵情于山谷之中，混乱开始了。其中一个在掩藏小鹿的灌木丛附近停下，他的脸上露出对周围自然美景的惊奇。在那一刻，人与自然之间的界限模糊了，整个**如画**的山谷都是和平的。
