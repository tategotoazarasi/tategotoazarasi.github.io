The first diagram illustrates the life cycle of the silkworm, while the second diagram outlines the stages involved in producing silk cloth.

Initially, the life cycle begins when a moth lays its eggs. After approximately 10 days, the eggs hatch into silkworm larvae, which feed on mulberry leaves for a period of 4 to 6 weeks. During this time, the larvae grow and eventually begin to produce silk thread, which they use to spin cocoons around themselves. This cocooning process typically lasts between 3 to 8 days. After spending about 16 days in the cocoon, the moth emerges, completing the life cycle.

The production of silk cloth starts with the selection of high-quality cocoons. These cocoons are then boiled in water, a process that kills the larvae inside. The boiled cocoons are subsequently unwound to extract silk threads, which can range from 300 to 900 meters in length per cocoon. The final stages of production involve twisting and weaving the threads into silk fabric, which is then dyed to achieve the desired color.

It is important to note that not all cocoons are used for silk production. A portion of them is preserved to allow the moths to emerge, ensuring the continuation of the life cycle and future silk production.
