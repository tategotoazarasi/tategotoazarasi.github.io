In the chill of the autumn evening, Margaret gazed forlornly at the **wardrobe** containing her few earthly possessions. Though the **shambles** of her life weighed heavily, she was not **oblivious** to the sights and sounds around her. The trees' auburn leaves quivered in the gusty winds, their fiery hues reaching their **ripe** peak before inevitable decline. A **slight** smile tugged at her lips as she recalled happier times, now tinged with **wretched** melancholy.

在秋日寒冷的夜晚，玛格丽特凄凉地凝视着那装着她为数不多的世俗财产的**衣柜**。尽管她生活的**混乱**状况让她倍感沉重，但她并非**无视**周围的景象和声音。树木的红褐色叶子在阵阵**狂风**中颤动，炽热的色彩正达到**成熟**的顶峰，随之而来的是不可避免的衰败。她嘴角露出一丝**微笑**，回忆起那些如今带着**痛苦**忧伤的快乐时光。

Those memories were but phantoms, faded **drab** apparitions in the grey **limbo** of her mind. Yet in that moment, they possessed vivid **majesty**, transporting her to summers basked in the **thoughtless** bliss of youth. She could almost feel the **drench** of the meadow's dewy grass, taste the crisp tartness of freshly plucked apples. So **absorbed** was she that she failed to hear the creak of the door.

那些记忆不过是幻影，在她心灵灰色**边缘**中的**暗淡**影像。然而在那一刻，它们却拥有生动的**庄严**，把她带回了沐浴在**无忧无虑**青春中的夏日。她几乎能感觉到草地上露水的**湿润**，尝到刚摘下的苹果的清脆酸味。她如此**沉浸**其中，以至于没有听到门的吱呀声。

"Evening, Miss Lewis," rumbled a gruff voice, startling her. She whirled to face her landlord, Mr. Willingham, grasping a **cane** and regarding her with a **bemused** expression. "The rent was **due two weeks ago**. You're going to have to **pull off** that sum soon, or I'll be **bound to** evict you, **in spite of** my fondness."

“晚上好，刘易斯小姐，”一个粗哑的声音响起，把她吓了一跳。她转身面对她的房东威灵汉姆先生，他拄着一根**手杖**，带着一种**困惑**的表情看着她。“房租**两周前**就到期了。你得尽快**弄到**那笔钱，不然尽管我很喜欢你，我也**一定要**把你赶走。”

Margaret's shoulders sagged, her brief reverie shattered. "I'm doing all I can **on a shoestring**, sir. This **manuscript** may be my last hope. If the publishers accept it..." Her voice **faltered** as doubt crept in.

玛格丽特的肩膀垂了下来，她短暂的沉思被打断。“我正在尽力**节省**开支，先生。这本**手稿**可能是我最后的希望。如果出版社接受它……”随着疑虑的侵入，她的声音**颤抖**了。

Mr. Willingham snorted. "Easier for a **camel to pass through** the eye of a needle. But I'll not lose faith yet." He tapped his **cane** thoughtfully. "That **adversary** of yours, young Gerald from the bookshop, has been **furrow**ing his brow over your work." A sly grin crossed his **drab** features. "If he can **pull it off**, perhaps there's a chance, eh?"

威灵汉姆先生嗤之以鼻。“**骆驼穿过**针眼都更容易。但我还不会完全失去信心。”他若有所思地敲了敲**手杖**。“你的那个**对手**，书店里的小杰拉尔德，一直在对你的作品**皱眉**。”他的**暗淡**面容上露出狡黠的笑容。“如果他能**成功**，也许还有希望，是吧？”

As he shuffled away, Margaret felt a **slight** spark rekindle within her breast. With a weary sigh, she closed the **wardrobe** and settled into the **rocking** chair, **absorbed** once more in the pages before her. Maybe, just maybe, her dreams had not yet reached their **culmination**.

当他蹒跚离开时，玛格丽特感到心中重新燃起一丝**微光**。她疲惫地叹了口气，关上**衣柜**，坐到**摇椅**上，再次**沉浸**在眼前的书页中。或许，她的梦想还没有到达**顶峰**。
