The diagram illustrates the process involved in manufacturing instant noodles, which consists of eight main steps, from storing raw materials to packaging the final product.

Initially, flour is transported from trucks into large storage silos via a pipe. When needed, the flour is directed from the silos into a mixing chamber, where it is combined with water and oil to form a dough. This dough then passes through a series of rollers, which flatten it into thin sheets. Following this, the dough sheets are cut into thin strips to form individual noodles.

In the subsequent stage, these noodle strips are molded into disc shapes. The noodle discs are then deep-fried to remove excess moisture and ensure long shelf life before being dried. Once dried, the noodle discs are placed into cups, where they are accompanied by dried vegetables and spices to enhance flavor.

The final step in the process is labeling and sealing. Once the cups are securely packaged, they are ready to be distributed to retailers for sale.

In summary, the production of instant noodles requires a multi-stage process that transforms raw ingredients into a packaged food product ready for consumption.
