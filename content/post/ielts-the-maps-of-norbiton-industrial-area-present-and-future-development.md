The maps illustrate the current layout of the Norbiton industrial area and the proposed changes for its future development.

In the present, the industrial zone is situated to the east of the town, bordered by a river to the north and a main road running along the southern edge. The area consists of several factories, with a roundabout at its center. This roundabout connects directly to the main road, and a secondary road branches off towards the east, where more factories are located on either side. Beyond the river, farmland stretches across the northern boundary of the area.

In the proposed future development, the industrial area will be transformed into a residential neighborhood. The factories will be replaced with housing, and new public facilities, including a medical center and shops, will be constructed around the central roundabout. The infrastructure will also be expanded, with a bridge built to the north, allowing access across the river to the farmland. Additionally, a new road will lead westward, connecting more housing developments to the town. Further to the east, a playground and a school will be added, providing essential amenities for the new residents.

Overall, the development plan indicates a complete conversion of the industrial area into a residential district, with enhanced infrastructure and public services.
