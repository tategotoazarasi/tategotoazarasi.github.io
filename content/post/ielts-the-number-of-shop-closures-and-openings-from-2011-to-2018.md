The line graph illustrates the number of shops that opened and closed in a particular country over the period between 2011 and 2018.

Overall, the number of shop openings followed a general downward trend, while shop closures experienced more fluctuation. It is noteworthy that, except for 2015, the number of closures remained consistently higher than the number of openings throughout the given period.

In 2011, the number of new shops opening was 8,500, significantly higher than the 6,500 closures. However, the number of openings plummeted to just 4,000 by 2012, whereas closures remained relatively stable, slightly dropping to 6,000. From 2013 to 2014, shop openings increased to 6,000, though they never exceeded the number of closures, which hovered around 6,500 during the same period.

A dramatic shift occurred in 2015, when closures reached their lowest point at 500, which was well below the 4,000 new openings that year. However, this decline in closures was temporary, as their number surged back to 5,000 in 2016. Over the last two years, the number of both openings and closures fluctuated slightly, ending at around 3,000 for openings and just above 5,000 for closures in 2018.
