The diagram illustrates the stages of sugar manufacturing from sugar cane. It takes 7 steps to make sugar from sugar cane.

Initially, sugar canes take 12 to 18 months to grow, and then harvested by machine or by hand. The next step is crushing. It is done by a machine, with harvested sugar canes as input, which are crushed and become juice, as the output of the machine. The juice produced is furthur purified through limestone filters.

In the following stage, the purified juice is put into an evaporator, where it is turned into syrup after heating with fire. Sugar crystals are separated from syrup in the next phase called centrifuge. The last step is to dry and cool down the syrup and finally get the sugar in the end.

In summary, sugar canes go through 7 stages, transformed into juice and syrup during these processes and finally become sugar.
