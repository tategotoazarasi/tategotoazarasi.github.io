The provided charts give detailed information about the travel trends involving the UK from 1979 to 1999, as well as the most popular countries visited by UK residents in 1999.

The first chart shows the number of visits to and from the UK over a span of twenty years. There is a clear upward trend in both inbound and outbound travel. Notably, the number of UK residents traveling abroad increased significantly after 1985. Between 1979 and 1985, the number of UK residents traveling abroad rose from 10 million to 20 million. This growth rate accelerated, with an additional 10 million travelers in the following four years. Throughout the period, more UK residents traveled abroad than overseas residents visited the UK.

The second chart highlights the most popular destinations for UK residents in 1999. France was the most visited country, attracting over 10 million UK visitors. Spain was the second most popular destination, followed by the USA, Greece, and Turkey. There is a significant gap between the number of visitors to Spain and the USA, suggesting that proximity and development levels might influence travel choices. France and Spain, being closer and more developed, were preferred over more distant and less developed destinations like Greece and Turkey.

In conclusion, the data illustrate a significant increase in international travel by UK residents, with European destinations being the most favored.
