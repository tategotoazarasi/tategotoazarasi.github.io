The line graph illustrates the production volumes of suits, dresses, and coats in a garment factory over two decades, from 1990 to 2010, measured in millions of units.

Overall, the production of coats displayed a steady upward trend, eventually becoming the most produced item by the end of the period. In contrast, suits experienced some fluctuations, while dresses showed a moderate but consistent increase.

In 1990, the factory produced 15 million suits, making it the highest-produced item among the three categories. Suit production peaked in 1995 at 23 million units, but it subsequently declined to 16 million by 2005. Although it rose slightly to reach 19 million in 2010, suits were no longer the dominant product by the end of the period.

Production of coats began at only 7 million units in 1990, the lowest of the three. However, it quickly gained momentum, surpassing dress production in 1995 with 13 million units and outpacing suits by 2005. Coat production continued to climb steadily, reaching a peak of 25 million units in 2010, thereby making it the most manufactured item by that year.

Dress production was relatively stable yet gradually increased from 10 million units in 1990 to around 17 million in 2010. Although dresses remained the least produced garment throughout, they displayed steady growth over the two decades.

This clear trend indicates a significant shift in the factoryâ€™s production priorities, with coats eventually overtaking both suits and dresses to become the most commonly produced item by 2010.
