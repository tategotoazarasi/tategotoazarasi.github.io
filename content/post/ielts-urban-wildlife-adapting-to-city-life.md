In recent years, the **undertaking** of studying urban wildlife has gained momentum among ecologists. As cities expand, animals are forced to adapt to new **habitats** or risk **wasting away**. Many species have shown remarkable resilience, learning to **come in** and out of urban areas with ease.

近年来，研究**城市野生动物的**这项**工作**已在生态学家中**逐渐兴起**。随着城市的扩张，动物被迫适应新的**栖息地**，否则就有可能**逐渐衰弱**。许多物种展现出了惊人的适应力，学会了轻松地**进入**和**离开**城市区域。

Birds, in particular, have mastered the art of urban living. They **mingle** with city dwellers, often seen perched on buildings or **scuffling** for crumbs in parks. Some species even **crack down on** pests, helping to control insect populations. However, not all animals **come off** well in this new environment. Those unable to **keep up with** the rapid pace of urban development often struggle to survive.

尤其是鸟类，它们已掌握了在城市中生存的艺术。它们与城市居民**交融**，常常被看到栖息在建筑物上，或是在公园里**为碎屑而争斗**。一些物种甚至**严厉打击**害虫，帮助控制昆虫的数量。然而，并不是所有的动物在这种新环境中**表现得**都**很好**。那些无法**跟上**城市快速发展步伐的动物往往难以生存。

Urban planners are now working to create wildlife-friendly spaces within cities. Green corridors allow animals to **transit** safely between fragmented habitats. Parks and rooftop gardens provide  refuge for various species. These efforts aim to ensure that urban  wildlife doesn't just survive but thrives.

城市规划者现在正努力在城市中创造对野生动物友好的空间。绿色走廊让动物能够安全**穿越**被分割的栖息地。公园和屋顶花园为各种物种提供了庇护。这些努力旨在确保城市野生动物不仅能生存，而且能**茁壮成长**。

It's crucial not to **lump together** all urban animals as pests. Many play vital roles in maintaining ecological balance. **Straight away**, we must recognize the value of biodiversity in our cities. As humans **stand down** from their position of dominance over nature, we can create more harmonious urban ecosystems.

我们绝不能**把**所有的城市动物**一概而论**为害虫。许多动物在维持生态平衡中扮演着重要角色。**立刻**，我们必须认识到城市生物多样性的价值。随着人类**从**对自然的**统治地位退下**，我们可以创造出更加和谐的城市生态系统。

The challenge lies in balancing human needs with those of urban  wildlife. By understanding how animals adapt to city life, we can design smarter, more inclusive urban spaces. This approach benefits not only  wildlife but also enhances the quality of life for human residents,  creating cities that are truly alive and vibrant.

挑战在于如何平衡人类需求与城市野生动物的需求。通过理解动物如何适应城市生活，我们可以设计出更聪明、更包容的城市空间。这种方法不仅有利于野生动物，也提升了人类居民的生活质量，创造出真正充满活力的城市。
