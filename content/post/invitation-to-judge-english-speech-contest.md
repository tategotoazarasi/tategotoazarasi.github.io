Dear Professor Johnson,

On behalf of the Students' Union, I am writing to cordially invite you to serve as a judge for our upcoming English Speech Contest. The event aims to enhance students' oral English proficiency, complementing our curriculum's focus on reading and writing skills.

As a native English speaker and esteemed faculty member, your expertise would be invaluable in evaluating contestants' performances. The contest is scheduled for Monday, May 15th, from 9:00 AM to 12:00 PM in the Auditorium of Building A2.

Your participation would greatly contribute to the success of this event. We would be honored if you could confirm your availability by May 5th.

Thank you for your consideration. We look forward to your positive response.

Sincerely,
Li Ming
Organizing Committee, English Speech Contest
