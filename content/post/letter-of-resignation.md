Dear Mr. Wang,

I am writing to inform you of my decision to resign from my position as an editor at Designs & Fashions, effective June 23, 2024. This decision comes after careful consideration and reflection on my two-month tenure with the company.

While I have thoroughly enjoyed the positive work environment and the camaraderie among colleagues, I have come to realize that the nature of the work does not align with my career aspirations and personal strengths as I had initially anticipated. The fast-paced world of fashion editing, although exciting, requires a different skill set and passion than what I can offer to the role.

I sincerely apologize for any inconvenience my departure may cause to you and the team. I am committed to ensuring a smooth transition of my responsibilities and am willing to assist in training my replacement if needed.

I would like to express my gratitude for the opportunity to work with Designs & Fashions. The experience has been invaluable, and I have learned a great deal about the industry. I wish you and the company continued success in the future.

Thank you for your understanding.

Sincerely,
Li Ming
