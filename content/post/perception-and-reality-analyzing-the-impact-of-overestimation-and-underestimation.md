In the drawing, there are two football players: one is a goalkeeper standing in front of the goal, and the other is preparing to take a shot. The goalkeeper perceives himself as much smaller than his actual size, making the goal appear overwhelmingly large and easy to score in. Conversely, the attacker sees the goalkeeper as a giant, covering the entire goal, making it seem impossible to score.

The drawing conveys the message that people often overestimate the difficulties they face. This phenomenon is common; many individuals tend to be pessimistic about their challenges. For example, students might fear failing an exam because they struggled with a few questions, overlooking their overall preparation and performance. This skewed perception can hinder problem-solving and success. Therefore, it is crucial to assess situations realistically and maintain a balanced perspective to effectively address challenges and achieve success.
