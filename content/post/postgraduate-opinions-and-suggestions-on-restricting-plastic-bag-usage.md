Dear Editors,

I am writing to express my concerns about the unsuccessful restrictions on plastic bag usage in some regions, as reported in your recent article on "white pollution". While I firmly support the ban on plastic bags, it is crucial to understand why they remain widely used and address the root causes.

Plastic bags are popular due to their affordability, lightweight nature, and convenience â€“ advantages that other alternatives often lack. Any policy aimed at curbing plastic bag usage must overcome these inherent benefits to be truly effective. To this end, I would like to propose the following suggestions:

Firstly, increased investment in research and development of eco-friendly materials is essential. These materials should match or surpass the lightweight and convenient qualities of plastic bags while being environmentally sustainable.

Secondly, the government could consider raising taxes on plastic bag production and usage, thereby increasing their cost and diminishing their affordability advantage.

Lastly, supermarkets and retailers should provide free, reusable bag alternatives for at least one year to facilitate a smooth transition. This would ensure that the new, eco-friendly options become widespread and equally convenient for consumers.

By implementing a multi-pronged approach that addresses affordability, weight, and convenience, we can effectively tackle the plastic bag pollution crisis and pave the way towards a greener future.

Sincerely,
Li Ming
