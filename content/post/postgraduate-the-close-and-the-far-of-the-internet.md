The drawing titled "The 'close' and the 'far' of the Internet" depicts a spider-web-like structure with numerous cells, each containing an individual seated in front of a computer. This visual metaphor encapsulates the interconnected nature of the internet, illustrating how people occupy distinct positions within a vast network.

The spider-web structure symbolizes the internet, where each individual is connected through technology, allowing for the exchange of messages and information. Despite physical distances, individuals on the internet can feel an artificial sense of closeness, as if they are in proximity, when in reality, they might be geographically distant. Conversely, individuals who are physically near can feel emotionally or socially distant due to the lack of digital interaction.

The drawing poignantly captures how the internet has transformed our perceptions of proximity. Physical distances are rendered insignificant in the digital realm, enabling friendships and connections across oceans, while simultaneously fostering isolation among those in close physical proximity who might not engage online.

In conclusion, this drawing effectively illustrates the paradoxical nature of the internet, redefining notions of "close" and "far." However, its abstract nature might pose a challenge for some viewers to immediately grasp its underlying message.
