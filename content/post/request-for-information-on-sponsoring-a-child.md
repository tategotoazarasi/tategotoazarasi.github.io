Dear Project Hope Staff,

I am writing to inquire about the possibility of providing consistent financial aid through your esteemed program. I am eager to donate funds to support a child who resides in a remote and underprivileged area and has a strong desire to pursue higher education but lacks the financial means to do so.

Specifically, I wish to sponsor a child who aspires to attend high school and, eventually, university. I am committed to covering the tuition fees for both high school and university, provided that the student maintains satisfactory academic performance. Additionally, I will make monthly donations to cover the child's living expenses until they graduate.

Could you please inform me if Project Hope facilitates such peer-to-peer sponsorships? If so, I would be grateful if you could provide me with profiles of candidates who meet the criteria mentioned above.

Thank you for your dedication to improving the lives of children in need.

Yours sincerely,
Li Ming
