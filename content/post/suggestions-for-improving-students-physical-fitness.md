Dear President,

I am writing to propose several measures to enhance the physical fitness of our university students.

Firstly, I suggest increasing the frequency of physical education classes. Currently, students attend only one session per week, with some weeks having none at all. More regular exercise and training would directly contribute to improved physical condition.

Secondly, the university should invest in additional sports facilities and training grounds. This expansion would accommodate the increased number of physical education classes and provide students with more opportunities for exercise.

Lastly, I recommend organizing a sports event each semester. This would encourage students to participate in various athletic activities and motivate them to maintain regular exercise routines.

I believe these suggestions will significantly improve our students' overall health and fitness.

Yours sincerely,
Li Ming
