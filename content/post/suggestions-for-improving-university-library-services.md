Dear Library Staff,

As a devoted patron, I truly appreciate the resources and amenities our university library provides. However, I would like to propose a few recommendations to enhance the overall user experience.

Firstly, implementing a comprehensive online catalog system or installing computer terminals within the library would greatly facilitate book searches. This would enable students to easily locate desired materials, minimizing the need for staff assistance and saving valuable time.

Secondly, extending the library's operating hours, particularly during exam periods, would cater to the diverse schedules of students. Many find solace in the library's conducive study environment and would benefit from increased accessibility.

Finally, designating more quiet zones or individual study carrels would promote an atmosphere of focused learning. This would allow students to concentrate without distractions, fostering academic excellence.

I am confident that these suggestions, if implemented, will contribute to a more efficient and user-friendly library experience for the entire university community. Thank you for your consideration and continued dedication to supporting our educational pursuits.

Yours sincerely,
Li Ming
