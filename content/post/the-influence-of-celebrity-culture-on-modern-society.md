The first photo illustrates a man painting "BECKHAM," the name of a famous English football player, on his face. The second shows someone asking a barber to give him the same hairstyle as Beckham.

Beckham is a sports star with a substantial fan base, a phenomenon not unique to him. The culture of fandom has become a significant social phenomenon in the modern world. Football players, actors, and singers often have fans who exhibit extreme behaviors. They paint their idols' names on their skin, raise money for advertisements, and even quit jobs or schools to follow their stars, attending every concert or game their idols participate in. It seems as if their idol is the only thing that matters in their lives.

This phenomenon reveals that our society is failing to provide adequate spiritual fulfillment to meet people's needs. Although basic biological and material needs, such as food, housing, and decent living conditions, have been met, people's primary desires have shifted to a spiritual level.

Therefore, it is unproductive to simply blame the fans. Without better cultural products as alternatives, this trend will continue.
