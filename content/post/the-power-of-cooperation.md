In the drawing, two disabled individuals, one missing his left leg and the other his right, are depicted supporting each other while running with their combined legs, leaving their crutches behind. The caption below reads: "One leg from you, one leg from me; together we run north and south."

This drawing poignantly highlights the importance of cooperation. Neither of the disabled individuals can run independently, but by supporting each other, they transform their individual limitations into collective strength. The metaphor here is clear: cooperation can make one plus one greater than two.

The significance of cooperation extends beyond physical needs. Everyone has weaknesses or areas where they lack expertise. By collaborating with others who excel in these areas, individuals can focus on their strengths and develop deeper knowledge in their specific fields. This collaborative approach is foundational in the modern world, where teamwork often leads to more efficient and innovative outcomes than individual efforts alone.
