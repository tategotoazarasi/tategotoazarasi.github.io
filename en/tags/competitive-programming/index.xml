&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-problem&#34;&gt;The Problem&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In graph theory, the structural integrity of a network can often be analyzed by identifying fundamental shapes within it, such as triangles. A triangle provides rigidity and is a common motif in many applications. This problem asks us to identify vertices that are &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; part of any triangle. A vertex &lt;code&gt;i&lt;/code&gt; is defined as being part of a triangle if it has two distinct neighbors, &lt;code&gt;j&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;k&lt;/code&gt;, which are also neighbors of each other. Our task is to find all vertices that do not satisfy this condition, which the problem statement refers to as &amp;ldquo;weak vertices.&amp;rdquo; The graph is given to us in the form of an adjacency matrix.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;h3 id=&#34;problem&#34;&gt;Problem&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The recent schoolboard elections were hotly contested: a proposal to swap school start times for elementary and high
school students, a controversial new dress code proposal that bans athletic clothes in school, and a proposal to raise
real-estate taxes to pay for a new football practice facility, and the list goes on and on. It is now hours after the
polls have closed and a winner has yet to emerge!&lt;/p&gt;</description>
