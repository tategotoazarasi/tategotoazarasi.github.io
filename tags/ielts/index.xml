书籍、电视和广播是传递信息的主要媒介。
Books have existed for thousands of years in human history and remain a prevalent source of information today. Their primary advantage is their accessibility, allowing readers to revisit sections as needed, unlike TV or radio, where content is transient and less controllable. However, books lack the dynamic elements of sound and video, which is a significant disadvantage.
书籍在人类历史上已存在了数千年，如今仍然是一种普遍的信息来源。它们的主要优势在于易于获取，读者可以根据需要重复阅读特定部分，这是电视或广播所无法比拟的，因为它们的内容是短暂且不易控制的。然而，书籍缺乏声音和视频的动态元素，这是一个重大的劣势。
