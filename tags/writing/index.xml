Some argue that these high earnings are entirely justified, while others believe they are unjust and reflective of a skewed value system. This essay will discuss both perspectives before presenting my own viewpoint.
Proponents of high salaries for sports professionals often argue that these individuals possess unique talents that are highly sought after in the market.</description></item><item><title>Invitation to Judge English Speech Contest</title><link>https://tategotoazarasi.github.io/post/invitation-to-judge-english-speech-contest/</link><pubDate>Tue, 27 Aug 2024 16:15:18 +0800</pubDate><guid>https://tategotoazarasi.github.io/post/invitation-to-judge-english-speech-contest/</guid><description>Dear Professor Johnson,

In the left panel, labeled &amp;ldquo;30 years ago,&amp;rdquo; a young mother is shown holding her daughter&amp;rsquo;s hand and carrying a bag, symbolizing her role as caregiver and provider. The right panel, marked &amp;ldquo;Now,&amp;rdquo; portrays the same pair 30 years later, with the roles reversed—the grown daughter now supports her elderly mother.
这幅图像由两个部分组成，展示了母女关系在三十年间的演变。左侧的图像标注为“三十年前”，描绘了一位年轻的母亲牵着女儿的手，并提着包，象征着她作为照顾者和供养者的角色。右侧的图像标注为“现在”，呈现出三十年后的同一对母女，角色发生了逆转——长大的女儿现在扶着年迈的母亲。
This poignant illustration encapsulates the cyclical nature of familial care and societal support systems.</description></item><item><title>The Dominance of Advertising Over Consumer Needs in Modern Society</title><link>https://tategotoazarasi.github.io/post/the-dominance-of-advertising-over-consumer-needs-in-modern-society/</link><pubDate>Wed, 21 Aug 2024 16:37:34 +0800</pubDate><guid>https://tategotoazarasi.github.io/post/the-dominance-of-advertising-over-consumer-needs-in-modern-society/</guid><description>In today’s consumer-driven world, it is undeniable that advertising wields significant influence over purchasing behavior. The power of advertising often leads to the high sales of popular consumer goods, sometimes eclipsing the genuine needs of society. I strongly agree with this viewpoint, as modern advertising strategies frequently manipulate psychological triggers rather than cater to actual consumer requirements.
Advertising is designed to inform consumers about the benefits of a product, yet contemporary advertisements frequently go beyond mere information-sharing.</description></item><item><title>Suggestions for Improving Students' Physical Fitness</title><link>https://tategotoazarasi.github.io/post/suggestions-for-improving-students-physical-fitness/</link><pubDate>Tue, 20 Aug 2024 15:38:45 +0800</pubDate><guid>https://tategotoazarasi.github.io/post/suggestions-for-improving-students-physical-fitness/</guid><description>Dear President,
I am writing to propose several measures to enhance the physical fitness of our university students.
Firstly, I suggest increasing the frequency of physical education classes. Currently, students attend only one session per week, with some weeks having none at all. More regular exercise and training would directly contribute to improved physical condition.
Secondly, the university should invest in additional sports facilities and training grounds. This expansion would accommodate the increased number of physical education classes and provide students with more opportunities for exercise.</description></item><item><title>Global Water Usage by Sector from 1900 to 2000 and Water Consumption in Brazil and the Democratic Republic of Congo in 2000</title><link>https://tategotoazarasi.github.io/post/ielts-global-water-usage-by-sector-from-1900-to-2000-and-water-consumption-in-brazil-and-the-democratic-republic-of-congo-in-2000/</link><pubDate>Mon, 19 Aug 2024 17:44:45 +0800</pubDate><guid>https://tategotoazarasi.github.io/post/ielts-global-water-usage-by-sector-from-1900-to-2000-and-water-consumption-in-brazil-and-the-democratic-republic-of-congo-in-2000/</guid><description>The graph illustrates global water usage in three sectors—agriculture, industrial, and domestic—from 1900 to 2000, while the table compares water consumption between Brazil and the Democratic Republic of Congo in 2000.
Over the century, global water usage in all three sectors increased significantly, with agriculture consuming the most water throughout the period.

In the center, their aged father is curled up like a ball, seemingly being kicked between them. This stark imagery vividly illustrates the troubling phenomenon of adult children evading their responsibilities towards their elderly parents.
This metaphorical representation critiques a growing social issue where some adult children view their aging parents as burdens, attempting to shift the responsibility of care onto their siblings.</description></item><item><title>Letter of Resignation</title><link>https://tategotoazarasi.github.io/post/letter-of-resignation/</link><pubDate>Fri, 09 Aug 2024 17:32:51 +0800</pubDate><guid>https://tategotoazarasi.github.io/post/letter-of-resignation/</guid><description>Dear Mr. Wang,

While both innate characteristics and life experiences undoubtedly shape our personalities and development, I believe that the characteristics we are born with exert a more significant influence. Among these inherent traits, curiosity stands out as a pivotal factor in personal growth and achievement.
Curiosity, the intrinsic desire to explore and understand, is a powerful motivator behind many accomplishments.</description></item><item><title>Analysis of Underground Railway Systems in Six Cities</title><link>https://tategotoazarasi.github.io/post/ielts-analysis-of-underground-railway-systems-in-six-cities/</link><pubDate>Thu, 08 Aug 2024 15:33:54 +0800</pubDate><guid>https://tategotoazarasi.github.io/post/ielts-analysis-of-underground-railway-systems-in-six-cities/</guid><description>The table illustrates data regarding the underground railway systems in six cities, focusing on their opening dates, route lengths, and annual passenger numbers.

The goalkeeper perceives himself as much smaller than his actual size, making the goal appear overwhelmingly large and easy to score in. Conversely, the attacker sees the goalkeeper as a giant, covering the entire goal, making it seem impossible to score.

While this intermission undoubtedly offers valuable opportunities for personal growth and rejuvenation, it also carries potential risks that should not be overlooked.
On the positive side, a gap year provides young individuals with a much-needed respite from the relentless academic pressure they endured throughout high school.

First and foremost, it is indeed true that gender proportions vary across different subjects. Gender inequality in education does exist, and it is a significant problem rooted in family and societal norms. Many people still harbor stereotypes and discriminatory beliefs, such as the notion that girls cannot be engineers. However, imposing a gender quota on university admissions will not address the root causes of this issue.</description></item><item><title>Aging Population Trends Across Nations</title><link>https://tategotoazarasi.github.io/post/ielts-aging-population-trends-across-nations/</link><pubDate>Tue, 04 Jun 2024 17:05:14 +0800</pubDate><guid>https://tategotoazarasi.github.io/post/ielts-aging-population-trends-across-nations/</guid><description>The line graph depicts the projected proportion of the population aged 65 and over in Japan, Sweden, and the USA, spanning from 1940 to 2040. It is evident that an aging population is a pervasive trend across these nations, albeit with distinct trajectories.
In the early decades, the USA and Sweden exhibited similar patterns, with the elderly constituting 5-10% of the population in 1940-1960, gradually increasing to 10-15% by 1980. Subsequently, the trajectories diverged, as Sweden&amp;rsquo;s aging population escalated more rapidly, surpassing 20% by 2020, while the USA&amp;rsquo;s figures remained relatively stable until the present day.</description></item><item><title>Tackling Student Behavioral Issues in Schools</title><link>https://tategotoazarasi.github.io/post/ielts-tackling-student-behavioral-issues-in-schools/</link><pubDate>Fri, 24 May 2024 18:12:39 +0800</pubDate><guid>https://tategotoazarasi.github.io/post/ielts-tackling-student-behavioral-issues-in-schools/</guid><description>While it is true that student misbehavior has become a severe problem in many countries, leading to issues like bullying, substance abuse, and violence, we cannot simply blame the students or expect them to behave well without addressing the underlying societal causes.
The modern school system originated from 19th-century Prussia, where children were required to attend schools, follow a strict curriculum, and pass standardized exams.
